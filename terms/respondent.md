**SURVEY RESPONDENTS PRIVACY POLICY**

Pollfish values your privacy and is dedicated to the establishment of a fully transparent relationship between us, with regards to the ways we collect and process your Personal Data. This Policy describes in detail what data we collect and process about you, the purposes of processing, our processing activities, possible disclosures of your Personal Data to third parties as well as your rights and opt-out options.

**1. WHO WE ARE**

Pollfish Inc. (hereinafter &quot;Pollfish&quot;) is a US company seated at 1460 Broadway New York, NY 10036, USA. Pollfish operates a Greek Branch (hereinafter &quot;the Branch&quot;) located at Pirri 5 Athens, Attica 11527, GR.

**2. WHAT WE DO**

**2.1**  Pollfish operates an on-line survey platform, through which a researcher (the &quot;Researcher&quot;) may conduct surveys. Pollfish collaborates with publishers of applications for smartphones and or website owners (collectively &quot;App-Publishers&quot;), in order to have access to users of such applications/websites and deliver surveys to targeted users.

More specifically, cooperating App-Publishers integrate in their apps a Pollfish API, through which, every time an app user connects to the application, a certain set of anonymous automatically received data (please see section 3.1 of this Policy), are sent to Pollfish. Pollfish then processes such automatically received data in order to discern whether an app-user is eligible for survey tendering.
 Pollfish may also target such app-users and tender to them sociodemographic (please see section 3.2 of this Policy) questionnaires, in order to better understand the sociodemographic profile of an app-user, with the purpose of better discerning whether such user would satisfy the audience segment criteria set by a Researcher, according to the procedure described in section 2.2 below.

**2.2**  By registering to Pollfish, a Researcher can create a survey questionnaire (or provide a link to an existing questionnaire) and address the survey questionnaires to specific audience segments. The Researcher sets the targeting criteria and Pollfish distributes the surveys to the audience segments which meet the targeting criteria set by the Researcher. Pollfish distributes the surveys created by the Researcher, collects the survey responses of app-users who have agreed to take a Pollfish survey (the &quot;Pollfish Survey Respondents&quot;) and provides the Researcher with reports which consist of:
 (a) The Researcher&#39;s survey questions and the responses to such questions
 (b) Certain anonymous statistical and socio-demographic data pertaining to the statistical and socio-demographic profile of anonymous Pollfish Survey Respondents who have participated successfully in the Survey Process.

Following specific request by the Researcher Client, and where the Survey Respondent is reached via mobile (such option not being available for website app-users) Pollfish may also provide the Researcher Client with a Pollfish Survey Respondent electronic identifier which may consist of:
 (a) the Survey Respondent Device ID and/or
 (b) the Survey Respondent Advertising ID.

**2.3**  Pollfish also cooperates with third-party survey-research partners (the &quot;Mediation Partners&quot;), which may target Pollfish Respondents on behalf of their own clients, by tendering third-party administered and operated surveys (the &quot;Mediation Surveys&quot;) to Pollfish Survey Respondents.

In order for such Mediation Partners to discern whether a Pollfish Survey Respondent is eligible for survey tendering, Pollfish may share of disclose to such Mediation Partners:
 (a) anonymous unique identifiers (i.e. the Pollfish Respondent Device ID and/or the Advertising ID)
 (b) certain automatically received data about the Pollfish Respondent and/or
 (c) sociodemographic data about Pollfish Respondents, insofar as and to the extent that such data may be available to Pollfish.

Pollfish only facilitates the process of Mediation Partners reaching and targeting Pollfish Respondents. Mediation Partners may use the data elements received about each Pollfish Respondent solely to identify survey tendering eligibility of a Pollfish Respondent.
 When a Pollfish Respondent is presented with a Mediation Survey:
 (i) the Pollfish Respondent is asked for his consent before taking a Mediation Survey
 (ii) Pollfish does not obtain any survey content information whatsoever, i.e. does not acquire knowledge or have access neither to the Mediation Survey questionnaires tendered nor to the Pollfish Respondent answers to such questions
 (iii) whenever a Pollfish Survey Respondent is targeted by a Mediation Partner, all data collected through the survey process itself, is governed by the Privacy Policy of that Mediation Partner.

All further processing of Pollfish Respondents&#39; data by the Mediation Partners is subject to their Privacy Policy, to which the Pollfish Respondent is requested to grant consent, before taking their surveys.

**2.4**  Pollfish finally, may cooperate with clients other than those identified under sections 2.2 and 2.3 above (i.e. other than the &quot;Researcher Clients&quot; and the &quot;Mediation Partners&quot;), and may sell or license your information to such clients (the &quot;Other Pollfish Clients&quot;).
 Such information shared is restricted to Automatically received data and sociodemographic data but does not include Content Data. Such Other Pollfish clients may consist of data brokers, data aggregators, advertisers, marketeers or data analysts, interested in obtaining anonymous information about you, for purposes such as: conducting marketing campaigns, direct electronic marketing, re-conducting data analyses, data matching, data validation, data append and coding, data segmentation, user rewarding, conduct of promotional campaigns, conducting digital security or anti-fraud analyses, serving you advertisements which may be of specific interest to you, conducting consumer profiling analyses, developing audience insights, performing analytics and providing marketing intelligence.

Information received via such cookie consists of a Pollfish generated alphanumeric identifier for that user.

**3.2 Sociodemographic Data**

These are data received by Pollfish, when Pollfish sends to an app-user a sociodemographic questionnaire (the &quot;Pollfish Internal Sociodemographic Survey&quot;), operated and administered internally by Pollfish itself (i.e. not on behalf of a Researcher or other Pollfish client) in order to better understand the sociodemographic profile of an app-user and thus discern whether this user would be eligible for survey tendering according to certain general or specific audience segment criteria as set each time by the Researcher Clients of Pollfish.

 Please note that Pollfish does not acquire access and knowledge of Content Data, in the case described under section 2.3 of this Policy (i.e. when a Pollfish user answers a Mediation Survey questionnaire).

**3.4 Communication Data**

If you choose to communicate with us (e.g. when you choose to exercise your Rights under this Policy), we may collect and process such communication data, including the content of our communications, but such collection and processing is strictly limited to the purpose of re-communicating with you about the subject of your initial communication.

**4. What measures do we take to protect the anonymity of the information collected?**

All data collected and processed under section 3 of this Policy is anonymous.

Despite the fact that Pollfish, by collecting and processing the app-user&#39;s Device and/or Advertising ID identifiers and by correlating/associating such data with the other categories of data collected, is considered, under law, to process &quot;Personal Data&quot; of the Pollfish Respondents, Pollfish takes additional measures, in a best effort basis, to ensure and protect the anonymity of such data.
 In that sense, Pollfish  **does not**  collect or process and  **does not allow**  Researcher Clients (through the survey questionnaires drafted by them) to ask questions about and/or collect real identifiers or direct personally identifiable information of a Pollfish Respondent, such as

- e-mail
- identity card number
- insurance number
- driver&#39;s license number
- passport number
- social security number
- credit/debit card number
- and/or any similar identifiers which are able to lead directly to the real-life identity of a data-subject.

Please note that if you choose to communicate with us for any reason (e.g. for exercising your Data Protection related rights, or for any other reason, we do collect and process personally identifiable information submitted by you (e.g. name, e-mail, address etc.) but such collection and processing is strictly limited to the purpose of re-communicating with you about the subject of your initial communication.

**5. CONSENT**

We collect and process your personal data only after you have provided clear opt-in consent to us for such collection and processing. Your consent is the main legal basis of collection and processing, however, depending on the processing activity, (please see section 6 of this Policy) we may further process your data under legal bases other than your consent.

By accepting this Privacy Policy, you grant to us your (revocable at any time) consent for the collection and processing of your Personal Data in accordance to this Policy. Furthermore, your explicit opt-in consent is provided to us in all stages of Pollfish interaction with you, and more specifically in the following circumstances and under the following procedures:

**(a) Automatically received data.** Automatically received data is collected and processed by us under your consent. When you choose to use an app which cooperates with Pollfish, you are informed, in such app&#39;s privacy policy, that the app interoperates with Pollfish and you are further informed about the categories of data collected about you by Pollfish and the purposes of such data processing by us.
 The aforementioned data are, therefore, collected by Pollfish under your permission and consent, which has already been granted by you by accepting the app&#39;s terms and conditions/privacy policy provided by the App Publisher. Please note that, as regards collection of the above data by Pollfish, Pollfish collects such automatically received data (or portion thereof) only insofar as, by accepting the app-publisher&#39;s terms of use, you have consented to the collection and processing of such data (or portion thereof). If you have blocked collection of such data (or parts of such data) either by withholding consent in the process of accepting the App Publisher&#39;s ToS (according to the privacy options provided to you by the App Publisher), or by disabling relevant device settings, Pollfish shall not be able to collect such withheld data.

**(b) Sociodemographic data.** Whenever an app-user is served a Pollfish Internal Sociodemographic Survey, Pollfish asks for the user&#39;s consent with regards to the collection and processing of his data. The app-user is presented with a brief but accurate description of what data we collect, the purposes of processing and the recipients of data. Furthermore, the app-user is also referred to this Privacy Policy for more detailed information and is then asked to provide clear opt-in consent in order to take the survey. Subject to this opt-in consent, Pollfish collects and processes the Pollfish Respondent sociodemographic data according to this Policy.

**(c) Content data.** Whenever a Pollfish Respondent is served a Researcher Client survey, all collection and processing of Content Data takes place under the same conditions and according to the same consent-granting procedure described in section 5 (b) above.

Please note that, whenever an app-user declines to take a survey or declines acceptance of this Policy, Pollfish will not proceed to any further collection of the app-user data in the future but can at all times use and process already collected automatically received data. If the app-user wants Pollfish to erase such data, he can at all times exercise this right according to the procedure set-out in section 14 of this Policy.

**12. PROTECTION OF MINORS**

Pollfish takes all necessary actions to comply with COPPA and the GDPR and protect the rights and safety of children under 16 years old (Minors). We make efforts to exclude Minors from any collection of data and therefore we delete any information and data that has come to our attention that is related with Minors without any notice.
 More specifically, Pollfish does not knowingly direct surveys to any person under the age of 16.
 Pollfish makes all reasonable efforts to identify, through its own audience screening procedures, the age of an eligible respondent. If an eligible respondent is identified to be under the age of 16, Pollfish will block such respondent from any survey tendering and shall mark such respondent as ineligible, with the aim of safeguarding that no child under the age of 16 is ever knowingly targeted by Pollfish in the future.
 If, despite our screening efforts, it has come to your attention anything regarding this issue please contact us immediately.
