**POLLFISH PRIVACY POLICY**

(PRIVACY POLICY FOR USERS OF APPS COLLABORATING WITH POLLFISH)

Pollfish values your privacy and is dedicated to the establishment of a fully transparent relationship between us, with regard to the ways we collect and process your data. This policy describes in detail what data we collect and process about you, when you are using apps collaborating with Pollfish and/or when you are responding to Surveys (as defined below) or interacting with Ads (as also defined below), the purposes of processing, our processing activities, possible disclosures of your personal data to third parties as well as your rights and opt-out options.

**1. WHO WE ARE**

Pollfish LLC. (hereinafter Pollfish) is a US company seated at 1460 Broadway New York, NY 10036, USA. Pollfish operates a Greek Branch (hereinafter the Branch) located at Pirri 5 Athens, Attica 11527, GR.

**2. WHAT WE DO**

Pollfish operates an on-line offer platform (“The Service”) through which an app-publisher may monetize publisher’s app. More specifically, Pollfish provides to the publisher the opportunity to display in the publisher’s app and thus expose app-users (the “User(s)” or “you”) to the following content (the “Offer(s)”- the term “Offers” meaning Surveys and/or Ads): 

**(a) Surveys.** Pollfish operates an on-line survey platform, through which researchers (the “Researcher(s)”) may conduct surveys (the “Survey(s)”). By registering to Pollfish, a Researcher has the opportunity to create a questionnaire (or ask Pollfish to create a questionnaire for him) and address the questionnaire to the specific public he targets. Pollfish collaborates with publishers of applications for smartphones and/or website owners (collectively hereinafter referred to as Publisher(s)) in order to have access to users of these applications and websites, tender surveys to them and collect survey responses from users having accepted to take a Survey (the “Pollfish Survey Respondents”, the “Respondents” or the “Pollfish Respondents”).

Pollfish also cooperates with third-party survey-research partners (the "Mediation Partners"), which may target Pollfish Respondents on behalf of their own clients, by tendering, via Pollfish, third-party administered and operated Surveys (the "Mediation Surveys") to Pollfish Survey Respondents.

**(b) Actionable Ads (the “Ads”).** Pollfish may serve to Publisher and thus the User may be presented third-party administered actionable ad content such as advertising videos, playable advertisements and related third-party advertisements. Said Ads are “actionable”, meaning that the User is invited to act as prompted by the Ads and complete such tasks as invited by the Ad.



**3. WHAT DATA WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU**

**3.1 General: Data we collect about you are divided into four categories:**

**(a) Automatically Received Data.** Publishers cooperating with Pollfish integrate in their apps a Pollfish API, through which, every time a User connects to the application, a certain set of anonymous, automatically received data, are automatically sent to Pollfish.

**(b) Survey Data.** These are data we collect about you when you choose to answer a Pollfish Survey.

**(c) Communication Data.** These are data we collect about you when you choose to directly communicate with us for any reason or purpose.

**(d) Verification Data.** In order for us to verify that a User is not a bot, we may use phone verification procedures. This applies only when and if you are accessing an Ad and does not apply to Surveys. Before you access an Ad, you may be requested to voluntarily provide your phone number. You will then be sent a sms, as part of our user-verification procedure. We will not share your phone number with any client of ours.  
Below, we provide to you, for each of the above categories, a full description of what data we collect and how we process them.

When a User visits a website which cooperates with Pollfish, Pollfish places and uses a cookie in order to receive information about the visitor pertaining to his possible eligibility for survey tendering. Information received via such cookie consists of a Pollfish generated alphanumeric identifier for that user.

In the case of Ads being displayed, and if you are on Desktop, we may also communicate with you, asking you to state what kind of device you own (Android, iPhone, iPad) in order for us to be able to render relevant ads. You can change this choice at any time. Although not automatically collected by us, we count this data as Automatically Received Data and treat them likewise.

**3.2.2 How we process and with whom we may share the Automatically Received Data.**

Pollfish processes the Automatically Received Data for the following purposes:

**-Survey-tendering.** Pollfish processes Automatically Received Data to discern whether an app-user is eligible for survey tendering and to further tender surveys to the User.

More specifically, in the framework of its market-research Survey activities, 

Pollfish may: 

**(a)** use the Automatically Received Data in order to target Users and tender to them internal, Pollfish-administered sociodemographic questionnaires. These Surveys are tendered in order for us to be able to understand the sociodemographic profile of a User. This helps us tender future market-research Surveys to such User on the basis of such User meeting (or not) audience segment criteria as set by a Researcher, every time we are commissioned to distribute Researcher’s market-research Surveys to Users. 

**(b)** use the Automatically Received Data in order to target Users and tender to them market-research Surveys as commissioned by our Researcher Clients. In that case we may share with the Researcher, along with the Survey Data (pls see section 3.3 below), also Automatically Received Data (such as your Advertising ID or Device ID, if available). 

**(c)** use the Automatically Received Data in order to target Users and tender to them market-research Surveys commissioned by our Mediation Partners. In that case, we may share with our Mediation Partners, along with Sociodemographic Data (pls see section 3.3 below) also Automatically Received Data (such as your Advertising ID or Device ID, if available). Sharing of such data with Mediation Partners helps them to discern whether a Pollfish Survey Respondent is eligible for survey tendering.  
Pollfish only facilitates the process of Mediation Partners reaching and targeting Users. Mediation Partners may use the data elements we provide to them solely to identify survey tendering eligibility of a User (for further information of how Mediation Partners use your data, pls see also section 3.3 below). 

**Ad-tendering.** Pollfish may process the Automatically Received Data to display Ads which may be of interest to a User.

Pollfish may share Automatically Received Data with collaborating third-party advertisers and/or their agents (the “Collaborating Advertisers”), in order for them to decide what Ads will be displayed and to instruct Pollfish to serve such Ads to Users, through their use of an app collaborating with Pollfish.

In the case mentioned above, Pollfish will be sharing with Collaborating Advertisers only Automatically Received Data. Pollfish does not and will not share with Collaborating Advertisers any Survey Data (data collected through any survey process, including collected sociodemographic data about a User). 

Ads served by Pollfish are controlled by our Collaborating Advertisers, who are independent third parties. If and when a User chooses to act as prompted by an Ad (e.g. submitting his email in a campaign, signing-up to a third-party service etc.) any and all data pertaining to such actions are collected and processed solely by Collaborating Advertisers, in accordance with their terms and conditions and privacy policies. Pollfish cannot and does not interfere with said process. Pollfish does not collect or process any data pertaining to a User’s interaction with an Ad as described above, and cannot know if a User has interacted or not with an Ad at the time such User interacts with an Ad. Before interacting with any third-party Ad displayed by Pollfish in the app you are using, you are advised to read such third-party’s terms of use and privacy policies. 

**Sharing Data with other Clients.** Pollfish may cooperate with clients other than Researchers, Mediation Partners and Collaborating Advertisers, and may sell or license Automatically Received Data to such clients (the "Other Pollfish Clients"). Such Other Pollfish clients may consist of data brokers, data aggregators, third-party advertisers, marketeers or data analysts, interested in obtaining anonymous information about you, for purposes such as: conducting marketing campaigns, direct electronic marketing, re-conducting data analyses, data matching, data validation, data append and coding, data segmentation, user rewarding, conduct of promotional campaigns, conducting digital security or anti-fraud analyses, serving you advertisements which may be of specific interest to you (other than the Ads served by us in the framework described above), conducting consumer profiling analyses, developing audience insights, performing analytics and providing marketing intelligence.

Please note that we may also use the Automatically Received Data and we may share such Data with certain other recipients, in accordance with Section 6 (c) – (f) and 7 of this Policy.


**3.3 Survey Data.** These are data collected whenever a User agrees to take a Survey. Survey Data collected and processed by us are the following:


**Sociodemographic Data**

These are anonymous data collected by Pollfish, whenever Pollfish sends to a User a sociodemographic questionnaire (the "Pollfish Internal Sociodemographic Survey"), operated and administered internally by Pollfish itself (i.e. not on behalf of a Researcher or other Pollfish client) in order to better understand the sociodemographic profile of a User and thus discern whether this User would be eligible for survey tendering, according to certain general or specific audience segment criteria as set in the future by a Researcher commissioning us to distribute market-research Surveys.


Information collected through this process consists of the following information:

- gender
- age
- education
- income level
- race
- spoken languages
- organization role
- organization size
- year of birth
- marital status
- employment
- career
- number of employees
- zip code

**Data collected through the Market-Survey Process (&quot;Content Data&quot;)**

When Pollfish invites the User to take a market-research Survey which a Researcher Client has commissioned us to distribute, Pollfish collects and processes information which consists of the Pollfish Respondent's anonymous answers to the survey questionnaires drafted by our Researcher Clients.

**3.3.1 How we process and with whom we may share the Survey Data.** Without prejudice to section 6 (c)- (f) and section 7 of this Policy, Survey Data collected by us may be shared with the following recipients:

**-Researcher Clients.** As part of the service, we provide to our Researcher Clients, we provide to our Researcher Clients Survey reports which include the Sociodemographic data, the Content Data and certain Automatically Received Data (such as your Advertising or Device ID, if available to us, and if a Researcher Client has asked to be provided such data).

**- Other Pollfish Clients.** We may provide Sociodemographic Data (along with certain Automatically Received Data) - but not any Content Data- to “Other Pollfish Clients” as described in section 3.2.2 above.

**Note for Mediation-Partner Surveys.** As noted, Pollfish cooperates with third-party survey-research partners (the "Mediation Partners"), which may target Pollfish Respondents on behalf of their own clients, by tendering third-party administered and operated surveys (the "Mediation Surveys"), via Pollfish, to Pollfish Survey Respondents.

In order for such Mediation Partners to discern whether a Pollfish Survey Respondent is eligible for survey tendering, Pollfish may share or disclose to such Mediation Partners Automatically Received Data, as well as Sociodemographic Data.

Pollfish only facilitates the process of Mediation Partners reaching and targeting Pollfish Respondents. Mediation Partners may use the data elements we share with them, as described above, solely to identify survey tendering eligibility of a User. 

When a User is presented with a Mediation Survey: (i) the User is asked for his consent before taking a Mediation Survey (ii) Pollfish does not obtain any Survey Content information whatsoever, i.e. does not acquire knowledge or have access neither to the Mediation Survey questionnaires tendered nor to the Pollfish Survey Respondent answers to such questions (iii) whenever a Pollfish Survey Respondent is targeted by a Mediation Partner, all data collected through the survey process itself, is governed by the privacy policy and terms of use of that Mediation Partner. All further processing of Pollfish Survey Respondents' data by the Mediation Partners is subject to their privacy policy, to which the Pollfish Survey Respondent is requested to accept, before taking their surveys.
Please note that we may also use the Survey Data and we may share such Data with certain other recipients, in accordance with Section 6 (c) – (f) and Section 7 of this Policy.


**3.4 Communication Data**

If you choose to communicate with us (e.g. when you choose to exercise your rights under this Policy), we may collect and process such communication data, including the content of our communications. Such collection and processing are principally limited to the purpose of re-communicating with you about the subject of your initial communication.

However, please note that we may also share such data with certain other recipients, in accordance with Section 6 (c) – (f) and Section 7 of this Policy.

**3.5 Verification Data.** In order for us to verify that a User is not a bot, we may use phone verification procedures. Before you access an Ad (such process not applicable in the case of Surveys), you may be requested to voluntarily provide your phone number. Submission of your phone number is voluntary, and you may refuse sharing it. If you agree to submit your phone number for the purpose mentioned above, you will then be sent a sms, as part of our user-verification procedure. 

**We will not share your phone number with any client of ours.**  However, please note that we may share such data with certain other recipients, in accordance with Section 6 (c) – (f) and Section 7 of this Policy.


**4. What measures do we take to protect the anonymity of the information collected?**

All data collected and processed under sections 3.1, 3.3 and 3.5 of this Policy is anonymous.

Despite the fact that Pollfish, by collecting and processing the Users’ Device and/or Advertising ID identifiers (only if the User has enabled access to his Advertising ID/Device ID either through his system's settings or via a consent-prompt shown to him by the Publisher) and by correlating/associating such data with the other categories of data collected, is considered, under law, to process "Personal Data" of Users (as the term “Personal Data” is defined in the GDPR), Pollfish takes additional measures, in a best effort basis, to ensure and protect the anonymity of such data. In that sense, Pollfish, **with the exception of any communication data addressed to us or verification data submitted, does not** collect real identifiers or direct personally identifiable information of a User, such as: 

- surname or full-name
- address
- telephone number
- billing address
- e-mail
- identity card number
- insurance number
- driver&#39;s license number
- passport number
- social security number
- credit/debit card number
- and/or any similar identifiers which are able to lead directly to the real-life identity of a data-subject.

As regards Surveys, **Pollfish does not allow Researchers to ask relevant questions** and/or collect any of the information listed above. 

**However, please note that if you act as prompted by a third-Party Ad and possibly submit any personal information during such process, any such personal information is collected and processed by such third-party in accordance with its own terms of use and privacy policies. Pollfish does not have access to any personal information or data whatsoever submitted to third-party Ads.**
