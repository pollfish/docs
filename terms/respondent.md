**SURVEY RESPONDENTS PRIVACY POLICY**

Pollfish values your privacy and is dedicated to the establishment of a fully transparent relationship between us, with regards to the ways we collect and process your Personal Data. This Policy describes in detail what data we collect and process about you, the purposes of processing, our processing activities, possible disclosures of your Personal Data to third parties as well as your rights and opt-out options.

**1. WHO WE ARE**

Pollfish Inc. (hereinafter &quot;Pollfish&quot;) is a US company seated at 1460 Broadway New York, NY 10036, USA. Pollfish operates a Greek Branch (hereinafter &quot;the Branch&quot;) located at Pirri 5 Athens, Attica 11527, GR.

**2. WHAT WE DO**

**2.1**  Pollfish operates an on-line survey platform, through which a researcher (the &quot;Researcher&quot;) may conduct surveys. Pollfish collaborates with publishers of applications for smartphones and or website owners (collectively &quot;App-Publishers&quot;), in order to have access to users of such applications/websites and deliver surveys to targeted users.

More specifically, cooperating App-Publishers integrate in their apps a Pollfish API, through which, every time an app user connects to the application, a certain set of anonymous automatically received data (please see section 3.1 of this Policy), are sent to Pollfish. Pollfish then processes such automatically received data in order to discern whether an app-user is eligible for survey tendering.
 Pollfish may also target such app-users and tender to them sociodemographic (please see section 3.2 of this Policy) questionnaires, in order to better understand the sociodemographic profile of an app-user, with the purpose of better discerning whether such user would satisfy the audience segment criteria set by a Researcher, according to the procedure described in section 2.2 below.

**2.2**  By registering to Pollfish, a Researcher can create a survey questionnaire (or provide a link to an existing questionnaire) and address the survey questionnaires to specific audience segments. The Researcher sets the targeting criteria and Pollfish distributes the surveys to the audience segments which meet the targeting criteria set by the Researcher. Pollfish distributes the surveys created by the Researcher, collects the survey responses of app-users who have agreed to take a Pollfish survey (the &quot;Pollfish Survey Respondents&quot;) and provides the Researcher with reports which consist of:
 (a) The Researcher&#39;s survey questions and the responses to such questions
 (b) Certain anonymous statistical and socio-demographic data pertaining to the statistical and socio-demographic profile of anonymous Pollfish Survey Respondents who have participated successfully in the Survey Process.

If 
 (a) if the Survey Respondent is reached via mobile apps using Pollfish SDK (such option not being available for website app-users), and
 (b) the Survey Respondent has enabled access to his Advertising and/or Device ID (either through his system&#39;s settings or via a consent-prompt shown to him by the publisher of the app he is using), and
 (c) following specific request by the Researcher Client, Pollfish may also provide the Researcher Client with a Pollfish Survey Respondent electronic identifier which may consist of: 
   (a) the Survey Respondent Device ID and/or
   (b) the Survey Respondent Advertising ID.

**2.3**  Pollfish also cooperates with third-party survey-research partners (the &quot;Mediation Partners&quot;), which may target Pollfish Respondents on behalf of their own clients, by tendering third-party administered and operated surveys (the &quot;Mediation Surveys&quot;) to Pollfish Survey Respondents.

In order for such Mediation Partners to discern whether a Pollfish Survey Respondent is eligible for survey tendering, Pollfish may share of disclose to such Mediation Partners:
 (a) anonymous unique identifiers (i.e. the Pollfish Respondent Device ID and/or the Advertising ID)
 (b) certain automatically received data about the Pollfish Respondent and/or
 (c) sociodemographic data about Pollfish Respondents, insofar as and to the extent that such data may be available to Pollfish.

Pollfish only facilitates the process of Mediation Partners reaching and targeting Pollfish Respondents. Mediation Partners may use the data elements received about each Pollfish Respondent solely to identify survey tendering eligibility of a Pollfish Respondent.
 When a Pollfish Respondent is presented with a Mediation Survey:
 (i) the Pollfish Respondent is asked for his consent before taking a Mediation Survey
 (ii) Pollfish does not obtain any survey content information whatsoever, i.e. does not acquire knowledge or have access neither to the Mediation Survey questionnaires tendered nor to the Pollfish Respondent answers to such questions
 (iii) whenever a Pollfish Survey Respondent is targeted by a Mediation Partner, all data collected through the survey process itself, is governed by the Privacy Policy of that Mediation Partner.

All further processing of Pollfish Respondents&#39; data by the Mediation Partners is subject to their Privacy Policy, to which the Pollfish Respondent is requested to grant consent, before taking their surveys.

**2.4**  Pollfish finally, may cooperate with clients other than those identified under sections 2.2 and 2.3 above (i.e. other than the &quot;Researcher Clients&quot; and the &quot;Mediation Partners&quot;), and may sell or license your information to such clients (the &quot;Other Pollfish Clients&quot;).
 Such information shared is restricted to Automatically received data and sociodemographic data but does not include Content Data. Such Other Pollfish clients may consist of data brokers, data aggregators, advertisers, marketeers or data analysts, interested in obtaining anonymous information about you, for purposes such as: conducting marketing campaigns, direct electronic marketing, re-conducting data analyses, data matching, data validation, data append and coding, data segmentation, user rewarding, conduct of promotional campaigns, conducting digital security or anti-fraud analyses, serving you advertisements which may be of specific interest to you, conducting consumer profiling analyses, developing audience insights, performing analytics and providing marketing intelligence.

**3.4 Communication Data**

If you choose to communicate with us (e.g. when you choose to exercise your Rights under this Policy), we may collect and process such communication data, including the content of our communications, but such collection and processing is strictly limited to the purpose of re-communicating with you about the subject of your initial communication.

 In that sense, Pollfish  **does not**  collect or process and  **does not allow**  Researcher Clients (through the survey questionnaires drafted by them) to ask questions about and/or collect real identifiers or direct personally identifiable information of a Pollfish Respondent, such as

- surname or full nameaddress

- e-mail
- identity card number
- insurance number
- driver&#39;s license number
- passport number
- social security number
- credit/debit card number
- and/or any similar identifiers which are able to lead directly to the real-life identity of a data-subject.

Please note that if you choose to communicate with us for any reason (e.g. for exercising your Data Protection related rights, or for any other reason, we do collect and process personally identifiable information submitted by you (e.g. name, e-mail, address etc.) but such collection and processing is strictly limited to the purpose of re-communicating with you about the subject of your initial communication.

**5. CONSENT**

We collect and process your personal data only after you have provided clear opt-in consent to us for such collection and processing. Your consent is the main legal basis of collection and processing, however, depending on the processing activity, (please see section 6 of this Policy) we may further process your data under legal bases other than your consent.

We collect Advertising/Device IDs, only if the Survey Respondent has enabled access to his Advertising/Device ID, either through his system&#39;s settings or via a consent-prompt shown to him by the publisher of the app he is using. 

By accepting this Privacy Policy, you grant to us your (revocable at any time) consent for the collection and processing of your Personal Data in accordance to this Policy.

**(b) Sociodemographic data.** Whenever an app-user is served a Pollfish Internal Sociodemographic Survey, Pollfish asks for the user&#39;s consent with regards to the collection and processing of his data. The app-user is presented with a brief but accurate description of what data we collect, the purposes of processing and the recipients of data. Furthermore, the app-user is also referred to this Privacy Policy for more detailed information and is then asked to provide clear opt-in consent in order to take the survey. Subject to this opt-in consent, Pollfish collects and processes the Pollfish Respondent sociodemographic data according to this Policy.

**(c) Content data.** Whenever a Pollfish Respondent is served a Researcher Client survey, all collection and processing of Content Data takes place under the same conditions and according to the same consent-granting procedure described in section 5 (b) above.

Please note that, whenever an app-user declines to take a survey or declines acceptance of this Policy, Pollfish will not proceed to any further collection of the app-user data in the future but can at all times use and process already collected automatically received data.

**12. PROTECTION OF MINORS**

Pollfish takes all necessary actions to comply with COPPA and the GDPR and protect the rights and safety of children under 16 years old (Minors). We make efforts to exclude Minors from any collection of data and therefore we delete any information and data that has come to our attention that is related with Minors without any notice.
 More specifically, Pollfish does not knowingly direct surveys to any person under the age of 16.
 Pollfish makes all reasonable efforts to identify, through its own audience screening procedures, the age of an eligible respondent. If an eligible respondent is identified to be under the age of 16, Pollfish will block such respondent from any survey tendering and shall mark such respondent as ineligible, with the aim of safeguarding that no child under the age of 16 is ever knowingly targeted by Pollfish in the future.
 If, despite our screening efforts, it has come to your attention anything regarding this issue please contact us immediately.

**11. CCPA COMPLIANCE**

Pollfish complies with the CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) Pollfish has decided to incorporate CCPA requirements in its general policies and use a uniform set of rules for all Pollfish Respondents irrespective of their place of residence. Therefore, the information provided in this section applies for California as well as for non-California residents alike.

Please note that under the CCPA, categories of personal information are grouped under certain titles explained in section 11.1 below.

**Please note that a YES marking to the categories of data under section 11.1 only indicates that Pollfish may collect and process some (and not all) data falling under these categories, solely according to the detailed description of data we collect under section 3 of this Policy.
 For example, a &quot;Yes&quot; marking in the Category &quot;Identifiers&quot; only suggests that we may collect and process your IP address or Device ID (as described in section 3.1 of this Policy) but we do not collect or process your full name, e-mail etc (as also explained in Sections 3 and 4 of this Policy).**
