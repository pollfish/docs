**PART A: TERMS OF USE**

**1. OUR SERVICE**

**1.1**  Pollfish operates an on-line survey platform, through which a researcher (the &quot;Researcher&quot; or &quot;You&quot;) may conduct surveys. Pollfish collaborates with publishers of applications for smartphones and or website owners (collectively &quot;App-Publishers&quot;), in order to have access to users of such applications/websites and deliver surveys to targeted users. More specifically, cooperating App-Publishers integrate in their apps a Pollfish API, through which, every time an app user connects to the application, a certain set of anonymous automatically received data (as defined in 3.2 of Pollfish Privacy Policy for users of apps collaborating with Pollfish located at [https://www.pollfish.com/terms/respondent](https://www.pollfish.com/terms/respondent)), are sent to Pollfish. Pollfish then processes such automatically received data in order to discern whether an app-user is eligible for survey tendering. Pollfish may also target such app-users and tender to them internal, Pollfish-administered sociodemographic questionnaires (please see section 3.3 “Sociodemographic Data”, of the Pollfish Privacy Policy for users of apps collaborating with Pollfish located at https://www.pollfish.com/terms/respondent) in order to better understand the sociodemographic profile of an app-user, with the purpose of better discerning whether such user would satisfy the audience segment criteria set by a Researcher, according to the procedure described in section 1.2 of this Part A of this Agreement below.

**1.2**  By registering to Pollfish, a Researcher can create a survey questionnaire (or provide a link to an existing questionnaire) and address the survey questionnaires to specific audience segments. The Researcher sets the targeting criteria and Pollfish distributes the surveys to the audience segments which meet the targeting criteria set by the Researcher. Pollfish distributes the surveys created by the Researcher, collects the survey responses of app-users who have agreed to take a Pollfish survey (the &quot;Pollfish Survey Respondents", the “Survey Respondents” or the “Respondents”) and provides the Researcher with reports (the &quot;Reporting Deliverables&quot;) which consist of: (a) The Researcher&#39;s survey questions and the responses to such questions (the &quot;Researcher Survey Data&quot;) (b) Certain anonymous statistical and socio-demographic data pertaining to the statistical and socio-demographic profile of anonymous Pollfish Survey Respondents who have participated successfully in the Survey Process, already existing (i.e. collected by Pollfish prior to the survey commissioned by the Researcher and/or out of such survey process) (the "Existing Pollfish Database Data"). Such sociodemographic data may include the following: gender, age, education, income level, race, spoken languages, organization role, organization size, year of birth, marital status, employment, career, number of employees, zip code. Following specific request by the Researcher, and where (i) the Survey Respondent is reached via mobile (such option not being available for website app-users) and (ii) the Survey Respondent has enabled access to his/her Advertising and/or Device ID either through his system&#39;s settings or via a consent-prompt shown to him/her by the publisher of the app he/she is using), Pollfish may also provide the Researcher with a Pollfish Survey Respondent electronic identifier which may consist of: (a) the Survey Respondent's Device ID and/or (b) the Survey Respondent's Advertising ID (in such a case, the term &quot;Existing Pollfish Database Data&quot; shall be deemed to include also the above-mentioned data).

**2. CHARGES &amp; PAYMENTS**

**2.1**  Researchers using standard Services provided through our website platform are charged per completed survey response received. However, a Researcher may request from Pollfish more specialized survey services. In the latter case, different charges may apply according to a special agreement, negotiated and concluded between Researcher and Pollfish; the amount owed depends on several criteria. Additional representation types for data collected maybe charged differently.

The fees corresponding to the use of standard services are indicated on our website. Such fees must be prepaid when requesting the survey. VAT, if available, may be added to the fees mentioned in the price list, depending on your location.

**2.2**  Researchers pay only per completed survey response they receive or, in case of special agreements, according to the agreed terms. More specifically, if you want to conduct a more specialized survey, the fees shall be agreed upon between Pollfish and Researcher, and a special contract shall be negotiated and concluded between the parties. In the event such complicated and specialized research is not fully accomplished, you will receive a partial refund equaling the pre-paid value of any non-delivered surveys.

**2.3**  Invoices are available through the Pollfish dashboard.

**2.4**  Please make sure that you have registered your current e-mail. You will also be asked at the registration stage to submit your VAT number, if you have one, according to your legislation.

**2.5**  If, for any reason, you dispute the transactions related to Pollfish services, you must notify Pollfish immediately in writing.

**2.6**  Pollfish is entitled to terminate the agreement if you do not pay the relevant costs/fees on time and/or any extra costs (including taxes, such as VAT).

**2.7**  Pollfish reserves the right to change the rates and charge differently for its Services. These changes will not affect the Researcher who has already paid fees for a survey.

**2.8**  The fee (as indicated on our website) must be paid via credit card or debit card or wire transfer or online banking or prepaid card. You may only order surveys if you are considered capable of entering into an enforceable contract in the applicable jurisdiction. You agree to pay in full the prices for the survey that you have ordered either by credit/debit card concurrently with your online order or by other payment means acceptable to Pollfish. If payment is not received by us from your credit or debit card issuer or its agents, you agree to pay all amounts due upon demand by us.

**2.9**  You are solely responsible for the payment of any banking and transaction costs. Any additional credit or debit charges that may incur due to the transaction will be paid by you and not by Pollfish.

**2.10**  In order to secure the payments through your credit cards, Pollfish collaborates with certified payment service providers operating according to the provisions of the applicable legislation. In order for the payment to be accomplished, you are directed to a secure page of the collaborating payment service provider which is linked to Pollfish website. There you register your card details, i.e. the full name of the owner of the card, the card number, the expiry date (month and year) of the card, the security code (verifying the authenticity of the card) imprinted in the appropriate space of the card reserved for the signature of the holder (CVV / VISA or CVC / MC), in order to check the validity of the cards and safely carry out the transaction. Pollfish does not store the data inserted by you in relation to the number of the card or the card security code verifying the authenticity of the card (for example CVV/VISA or CVC/MC). The payment service provider collaborating with Pollfish controls the data inserted and informs electronically Pollfish, for the approval or the rejection of the transaction. In case a transaction is rejected, irrespective of the reason of the rejection (which could be for example default on overdraft, failure of the system of the payment service provider or of the Bank issuing the card) you must ensure the payment, otherwise Pollfish is entitled to block your access to the platform.

**13. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS**

The past, present and future content of the Properties, including without limitation, copyright works and all intellectual property rights (including Industrial Property rights) such as software, logos, trademarks domain names, designs, graphics, pictures, photos, texts, newsletters, etc and any and all copyright material and all other intellectual property right and/or materials related to the Properties (collectively &quot;Content&quot;) are the sole property of Pollfish.

**14. PRESERVING CONFIDENTIALITY OF SURVEYS**

Pollfish understands that surveys distributed may include sensitive or confidential information about the Researcher&#39;s business and operations (e.g. launching of a new product, marketing strategies etc as such information may be revealed directly or indirectly through the contents of a certain survey), which the Researcher does not want to be made public or become accessible to competitors. Pollfish cannot guarantee that the Respondents will treat such information as confidential and that they will desist from divulging or reproducing it. Therefore, in case your survey contains confidential information you wish to protect, we advise you to draft your surveys accordingly. Here are some indicative steps you could follow, in order to reduce aforementioned risks:

(a) You could consider not using any mark, name, logo or other sign which may identify your Company,

(b) You could use an alternate-test name for the product related to your survey.

Please note that experience has proven that "confidentiality notifications" presented to the Respondent at the end of surveys usually has the opposite effect than the one expected, since Respondents seem to share information flagged as "confidential", more often than they do with information which is not directly identifiable as confidential or sensitive.
