**1. THE POLLFISH SURVEY LINK SERVICE**

**1.1**  Pollfish operates an on-line survey platform, through which a researcher (the &quot;Researcher&quot;) may conduct surveys. The Pollfish Survey Link Service (&quot;PSL Service&quot;), is a special service through which a Researcher may create questionnaires and be provided with a link, which Researcher may then distribute electronically to respondents of his own choice (via email or otherwise). The respondent (the &quot;Respondent&quot; or &quot;you&quot;) may click on the link and be shown the survey. Once the Respondent answers the survey questionnaire, the completed survey is stored by Pollfish, on behalf and under the instructions of the Researcher. Processing of your data by the Researcher is subject to Researcher’s privacy policies and terms, which the Researcher is obliged to inform you about, and request opt-in consent of yours, when the survey is distributed to you. We encourage you to read carefully Researcher’s terms and privacy policies before taking a survey.

**1.2**  Through the process described above, Pollfish collects and processes, on behalf and under the instructions of the Researcher, the following Respondent data (the &quot;PLS Survey Data&quot;):

(a) The Respondent&#39;s answers to the questionnaire distributed to the Respondent by the Researcher.

(b) certain anonymous passive Data of the Respondent and more specifically the following:

1. Device properties (IP address, operating system, browser and browser user agent, screen size and screen resolution)
2. The source where the respondent came from if available (e.g. Facebook, twitter, email etc.)

**1.3** All data mentioned above, are collected and processed by Pollfish on behalf and under the instructions of the Researcher, who is the Controller of such Data and determines the means and purpose of collection and further processing of such Data. Pollfish acts as Service Provider/Processor of abovementioned data. All Survey Data belong to the Researcher. Pollfish does not control the content of the Survey questionnaires and does not (a) provide to Researchers any pre-survey data of natural persons whatsoever (b) receive from Researchers any personal data, other than (i) those included/incorporated in the answers to the Survey questionnaires which are stored by Pollfish on behalf of the Researcher, after the completion of a Survey and (ii) the anonymous passive data automatically collected by Pollfish, as mentioned in section 1.2 above.

**1.4** Pollfish requests from Researchers to comply with applicable laws when using the PSL service, including standing personal data and anti-spam legislation.

**1.5** Pollfish does not interfere with (a) the selection of eligible respondents by Researcher (b) the targeting criteria (c) the distribution of the survey link by Researcher to the Respondents. Pollfish does not acquire access to any Respondent email, except if such email is submitted by the Respondent and thus is incorporated in the Survey Answers which are stored by Pollfish, on behalf of the Researcher, after the completion of a Survey.

**1.6** PII Collection by Researcher. Under the PSL special service (such option not being available under our standard service), the Researcher may ask questions of his sole choice, subject only to restrictions set out in applicable law. Please note that these questions may include questions inviting you to submit personally identifiable information, such as name, surname, email, telephone number or other identifiers. You may choose to submit or you may decline answering those questions, when answering a survey containing such questions. As already noted in section 1.3 above, the Researcher is the sole controller of relevant personally identifiable information possibly submitted in the survey process and Pollfish acts as processor of such information on behalf of the Researcher. Pollfish may not and will not use or further process such information but for the sole purpose of delivering the survey answers (including any PII information attached thereto), to the Researcher and storing them on his behalf. In other words, Pollfish shall never use these data for its own purposes (business or other), and may not (and will not) transfer, share or otherwise process such data, other than for the purpose of providing its services to the Researcher. 


**2. OWNERSHIP OF PSL SURVEY DATA.**

Researcher is the exclusive owner of all PSL Survey Data. Pollfish does not use or acquire access to any Survey Data, except for the purpose of providing its service to the Researcher. Under certain circumstances, Pollfish may be obliged to disclose said data to Public Authorities as required by applicable law, including the case of a subpoena, an investigation by Data Authorities or related procedure. Pollfish does not sell or share your data with any third party whatsoever, except from sharing your data with any (Researcher-approved) sub-processors used by us for performing our services to the Researcher. If you have any questions about how a Researcher administers, handles, shares or otherwise processes your data, please contact directly the Researcher who shared with you the Survey Link.

**3. PERSONAL DATA SECURITY AND LAWFUL PROCESSING**

**3.1**  Researcher is Controller of the PSL Survey Data. Pollfish is Processor of the PSL Survey Data. Processing of the PSL data by Pollfish is made on the basis of a Data Processing Agreement (including, where applicable, an applicable Standard Contractual Clauses) entered into between Researcher and Pollfish.
