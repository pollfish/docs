**1. THE POLLFISH SURVEY LINK SERVICE**

**1.1**  Pollfish operates an on-line survey platform, through which a researcher (the &quot;Researcher&quot;) may conduct surveys. The Pollfish Survey Link Service (&quot;PSL Service&quot;), is a special service through which a Researcher may create questionnaires and be provided with a link, which Researcher may then distribute electronically to respondents of his own choice (via email or otherwise). The respondent (the &quot;Respondent&quot; or &quot;you&quot;) may click on the link and be shown the survey. Once the Respondent answers the survey questionnaire, the completed survey is stored by Pollfish, on behalf and under the instructions of the Researcher.

**1.2**  Through the process described above, Pollfish collects and processes, on behalf and under the instructions of the Researcher, the following Respondent data (the &quot;PLS Survey Data&quot;):

(a) The Respondent&#39;s answers to the questionnaire distributed to the Respondent by the Researcher.

(b) certain anonymous passive Data of the Respondent and more specifically the following:

1. Device properties (IP address, operating system, browser and browser user agent, screen size and screen resolution)
2. The source where the respondent came from if available (e.g. Facebook, twitter, email etc.)

**1.3** All data mentioned above, are collected and processed on behalf and under the instructions of the Researcher, who is the Controller of such Data and determines the means and purpose of collection and further processing of such Data. Pollfish acts as Service Provider/Processor of abovementioned data. All Survey Data belong to the Researcher. Pollfish does not control the content of the Survey questionnaires and does not (a) provide to Researchers any data of natural persons whatsoever (b) receive from Researchers any personal data, other than (i) those included/incorporated in the answers to the Survey questionnaires stored by Pollfish after the completion of a Survey and (ii) the anonymous passive data automatically collected by Pollfish, as mentioned in section 1.2 above.

**1.4** Pollfish requests from Researchers to comply with applicable law when using the PSL service, including standing personal data and anti-spam legislation.

**1.5** Pollfish does not interfere with (a) the selection of eligible respondents by Researcher (b) the targeting criteria (c) the distribution of the survey link by Researcher to the Respondents. Pollfish does not acquire access to any Respondent email, except if such email is submitted by the Respondent and thus is incorporated in the Survey Answers which are stored by Pollfish after the completion of a Survey.

**2. OWNERSHIP OF PSL SURVEY DATA.**

Researcher is the exclusive owner of all PSL Survey Data. Pollfish does not use or acquire access to any Survey Data, except for the purpose of providing the service to the Researcher. Under certain circumstances, Pollfish may be obliged to disclose said data to Public Authorities as required by applicable law, including the case of a subpoena, an investigation by Data Authorities or related procedure. Pollfish does not sell or share your data with any third party whatsoever, except from sharing your data with any (Researcher-approved) subprocessors used by us for performing our services to the Researcher. If you have any questions about how the Researchers administer, handle, share or otherwise process your data, please contact directly the Researcher who shared with you the Survey Link.
