**PART B [Privacy Policy]** of this Agreement discloses the ways we process your personal information, the purposes of processing and your Privacy rights.

**In order to access the Pollfish Website and Service you are requested to accept and conform to this Agreement, otherwise you will not have access to our Services.**

**PART A: TERMS OF SERVICE**

**1. OUR SERVICE**

**1.1**  Pollfish operates an on-line survey platform, through which a researcher (the &quot;Researcher&quot; or &quot;You&quot;) may conduct surveys. Pollfish collaborates with publishers of applications for smartphones and or website owners (collectively &quot;App-Publishers&quot;), in order to have access to users of such applications/websites and deliver surveys to targeted users. More specifically, cooperating App-Publishers integrate in their apps a Pollfish API, through which, every time an app user connects to the application, a certain set of anonymous automatically received data (please see section 3.1 of the Respondent Privacy Policy located at [https://www.pollfish.com/terms/respondent](https://www.pollfish.com/terms/respondent)), are sent to Pollfish. Pollfish then processes such automatically received data in order to discern whether an app-user is eligible for survey tendering. Pollfish may also target such app-users and tender to them sociodemographic (please see section 3.2 of the Respondent Privacy Policy) questionnaires, in order to better understand the sociodemographic profile of an app-user, with the purpose of better discerning whether such user would satisfy the audience segment criteria set by a Researcher, according to the procedure described in section 1.2 of this Part A of this Agreement below.

**1.2**  By registering to Pollfish, a Researcher can create a survey questionnaire (or provide a link to an existing questionnaire) and address the survey questionnaires to specific audience segments. The Researcher sets the targeting criteria and Pollfish distributes the surveys to the audience segments which meet the targeting criteria set by the Researcher. Pollfish distributes the surveys created by the Researcher, collects the survey responses of app-users who have agreed to take a Pollfish survey (the &quot;Pollfish Survey Respondents&quot;) and provides the Researcher with reports (the &quot;Reporting Deliverables&quot;) which consist of: (a) The Researcher&#39;s survey questions and the responses to such questions (the &quot;Researcher Survey Data&quot;) (b) Certain anonymous statistical and socio-demographic data pertaining to the statistical and socio-demographic profile of anonymous Pollfish Survey Respondents who have participated successfully in the Survey Process (the &quot;Existing Pollfish Database Data&quot;). Following specific request by the Researcher, and where the Survey Respondent is reached via mobile (such option not being available for website app-users) Pollfish may also provide the Researcher with a Pollfish Survey Respondent electronic identifier which may consist of: (a) the Survey Respondent Device ID and/or (b) the Survey Respondent Advertising ID (in such a case, the term &quot;Existing Pollfish Database Data&quot; shall be deemed to include also the above-mentioned data).

**2. CHARGES &amp; PAYMENTS**

**2.1**  Researchers using standard Services provided through our website platform are charged per completed survey response received. However, a Researcher may request from Pollfish more specialized Survey-Services. In the latter case, different charges may apply according to a special agreement, negotiated and concluded between Researcher and Pollfish; the amount owed depends on several criteria. Additional representation types for data collected maybe charged differently.

The fees corresponding to the use of standard services are indicated on our website. Such fees must be prepaid when requesting the survey. VAT, if available, may be added to the fees mentioned in the price list, depending on your location.

**2.2**  Researchers pay only per completed survey response they receive or, in case of special agreements, according to the agreed terms. More specifically, if you want to conduct a more specialized survey, the fees shall be agreed upon between Pollfish and Researcher, and a special contract shall be negotiated and concluded between the parties. In the event such complicated and specialized research is not fully accomplished, you will receive a partial refund equaling the pre-paid value of any non-delivered Surveys.

**2.3**  Invoices are available through the Pollfish Dashboard.

**2.4**  Please make sure that you have registered your current e-mail. You will also be asked at the registration stage to submit your VAT number, if you have one, according to your legislation.

**2.5**  If, for any reason, you dispute the transactions related to Pollfish services, you must notify Pollfish immediately in writing.

**2.6**  Pollfish is entitled to terminate the agreement if you do not pay the relevant costs/fees on time and/or any extra costs (including taxes, such as VAT).

**2.7**  Pollfish reserves the right to change the rates and charge differently for its Services. These changes will not affect the Researcher who has already paid fees for a survey.

**2.8**  The fee (as indicated on our website) must be paid via credit card or debit card or wire transfer or online banking or prepaid card. You may only order surveys if you are considered capable of entering into an enforceable contract in the applicable jurisdiction. You agree to pay in full the prices for the survey that you have ordered either by credit/debit card concurrently with your online order or by other payment means acceptable to Pollfish. If payment is not received by us from your credit or debit card issuer or its agents, you agree to pay all amounts due upon demand by us.

**2.9**  You are solely responsible for the payment of any banking and transaction costs. Any additional credit or debit charges that may incur due to the transaction will be paid by you and not by Pollfish.

**2.10**  In order to secure the payments through your credit cards, Pollfish collaborates with certified payment service providers operating according to the provisions of the applicable legislation. In order for the payment to be accomplished, you are directed to a secure page of the collaborating payment service provider which is linked to Pollfish website. There you register your card details, i.e. the full name of the owner of the card, the card number, the expiry date (month and year) of the card, the security code (verifying the authenticity of the card) imprinted in the appropriate space of the card reserved for the signature of the holder (CVV / VISA or CVC / MC), in order to check the validity of the cards and safely carry out the transaction. Pollfish does not store the data inserted by you in relation to the number of the card or the card security code verifying the authenticity of the card (for example CVV/VISA or CVC/MC). The payment service provider collaborating with Pollfish controls the data inserted and informs electronically Pollfish, for the approval or the rejection of the transaction. In case a transaction is rejected, irrespective of the reason of the rejection (which could be for example default on overdraft, failure of the system of the payment service provider or of the Bank issuing the card) you must ensure the payment, otherwise Pollfish is entitled to block your access to the platform.

**3. REGISTRATION**

The past, present and future content of the Properties, including without limitation, copyright works and all intellectual property rights (including Industrial Property rights) such as software, logos, trademarks domain names, designs, graphics, pictures, photos, texts, newsletters, etc and any and all copyright material and all other intellectual property right and/or materials related to the Properties (collectively &quot;Content&quot;) are the sole property of Pollfish. Except as stated herein, no rights in or to the Content and/or to the Properties are granted to you.

**14. PRESERVING CONFIDENTIALITY OF SURVEYS**

Pollfish understands that surveys distributed may include sensitive or confidential information about the Researcher&#39;s business and operations (e.g. launching of a new product, marketing strategies etc as such information may be revealed directly or indirectly through the contents of a certain survey), which the Researcher does not want to be made public or become accessible to competitors. Pollfish cannot guarantee that the Respondents will treat such information as confidential and that they will desist from divulging or reproducing it. Therefore, in case your survey contains confidential information you wish to protect, we advise you to draft your surveys accordingly. Here are some indicative steps you could follow, in order to reduce aforementioned risks:

(a) You could consider not using any mark, name, logo or other sign which may identify your Company,

(b) You could use an alternate-test name for the product related to your survey.

Please note that experience has proven that &quot;confidentiality notifications&quot; presented to the Respondent at the end of surveys usually has the opposite effect than the one expected, since Respondents seem to share information flagged as &quot;confidential&quot;, more often than they do with information which is not directly identifiable as confidential or sensitive.

**I.**  **Obligations of the data exporter**

The data exporter warrants and undertakes that:

1. The personal data have been collected, processed and transferred in accordance with the laws applicable to the data exporter.

1. It has used reasonable efforts to determine that the data importer is able to satisfy its legal obligations under these clauses.

1. It will provide the data importer, when so requested, with copies of relevant data protection laws or references to them (where relevant, and not including legal advice) of the country in which the data exporter is established.

1. It will respond to enquiries from data subjects and the authority concerning processing of the personal data by the data importer, unless the parties have agreed that the data importer will so respond, in which case the data exporter will still respond to the extent reasonably possible and with the information reasonably available to it if the data importer is unwilling or unable to respond. Responses will be made within a reasonable time.

1. It will make available, upon request, a copy of the clauses to data subjects who are third party beneficiaries under clause III, unless the clauses contain confidential information, in which case it may remove such information. Where information is removed, the data exporter shall inform data subjects in writing of the reason for removal and of their right to draw the removal to the attention of the authority. However, the data exporter shall abide by a decision of the authority regarding access to the full text of the clauses by data subjects, as long as data subjects have agreed to respect the confidentiality of the confidential information removed. The data exporter shall also provide a copy of the clauses to the authority where required.

**II.**  **Obligations of the data importer**

The data importer warrants and undertakes that:

1. It will have in place appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect the personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access, and which provide a level of security appropriate to the risk represented by the processing and the nature of the data to be protected.

1. It will have in place procedures so that any third party it authorises to have access to the personal data, including processors, will respect and maintain the confidentiality and security of the personal data. Any person acting under the authority of the data importer, including a data processor, shall be obligated to process the personal data only on instructions from the data importer. This provision does not apply to persons authorised or required by law or regulation to have access to the personal data.

1. It has no reason to believe, at the time of entering into these clauses, in the existence of any local laws that would have a substantial adverse effect on the guarantees provided for under these clauses, and it will inform the data exporter (which will pass such notification on to the authority where required) if it becomes aware of any such laws.

1. It will process the personal data for purposes described in Annex B, and has the legal authority to give the warranties and fulfil the undertakings set out in these clauses.

1. It will identify to the data exporter a contact point within its organisation authorised to respond to enquiries concerning processing of the personal data, and will cooperate in good faith with the data exporter, the data subject and the authority concerning all such enquiries within a reasonable time. In case of legal dissolution of the data exporter, or if the parties have so agreed, the data importer will assume responsibility for compliance with the provisions of clause I(e).

1. At the request of the data exporter, it will provide the data exporter with evidence of financial resources sufficient to fulfil its responsibilities under clause III (which may include insurance coverage).

1. Upon reasonable request of the data exporter, it will submit its data processing facilities, data files and documentation needed for processing to reviewing, auditing and/or certifying by the data exporter (or any independent or impartial inspection agents or auditors, selected by the data exporter and not reasonably objected to by the data importer) to ascertain compliance with the warranties and undertakings in these clauses, with reasonable notice and during regular business hours. The request will be subject to any necessary consent or approval from a regulatory or supervisory authority within the country of the data importer, which consent or approval the data importer will attempt to obtain in a timely fashion.

1. It will process the personal data, at its option, in accordance with:

(i) the data protection laws of the country in which the data exporter is established, or

(ii) the relevant provisions of any Commission decision pursuant to Article 25(6) of Directive 95/46/EC (corresponding Article 45 of the GDPR), where the data importer complies with the relevant provisions of such an authorisation or decision and is based in a country to which such an authorisation or decision pertains, but is not covered by such authorisation or decision for the purposes of the transfer(s) of the personal data, or

(iii) the data processing principles set forth in Annex A.

Data importer to indicate which option it selects: \_\_\_\_\_\_(iii)\_(selected)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Initials of data importer: Researcher. ;

1. It will not disclose or transfer the personal data to a third-party data controller located outside the European Economic Area (EEA) unless it notifies the data exporter about the transfer and

1. the third-party data controller processes the personal data in accordance with a Commission decision finding that a third country provides adequate protection, or

(ii) the third-party data controller becomes a signatory to these clauses or another data transfer agreement approved by a competent authority in the EU, or

(iii) data subjects have been given the opportunity to object, after having been informed of the purposes of the transfer, the categories of recipients and the fact that the countries to which data is exported may have different data protection standards, or

(iv) with regard to onward transfers of sensitive data, data subjects have given their unambiguous consent to the onward transfer.

**III.**  **Liability and third**** party rights**

(a) Each party shall be liable to the other parties for damages it causes by any breach of these clauses. Liability as between the parties is limited to actual damage suffered. Punitive damages (i.e. damages intended to punish a party for its outrageous conduct) are specifically excluded. Each party shall be liable to data subjects for damages it causes by any breach of third-party rights under these clauses. This does not affect the liability of the data exporter under its data protection law.

(b) Each party shall perform its obligations under these clauses at its own cost.

(c) The parties will indemnify each other and hold each other harmless from any cost, charge, damages, expense or loss which they cause each other as a result of their breach of any of the provisions of these clauses. Indemnification hereunder is contingent upon (a) the party(ies) to be indemnified (the &quot;indemnified party(ies)&quot;) promptly notifying the other party(ies) (the &quot;indemnifying party(ies)&quot;) of a claim, (b) the indemnifying party(ies) having sole control of the defence and settlement of any such claim, and (c) the indemnified party(ies) providing reasonable cooperation and assistance to the indemnifying party(ies) in defence of such claim

(d) The parties agree that a data subject shall have the right to enforce as a third party beneficiary this clause and clauses I(b), I(d), I(e), II(a), II(c), II(d), II(e), II(h), II(i), III(a), V, VI(d) and VII against the data importer or the data exporter, for their respective breach of their contractual obligations, with regard to his personal data, and accept jurisdiction for this purpose in the data exporter&#39;s country of establishment. In cases involving allegations of breach by the data importer, the data subject must first request the data exporter to take appropriate action to enforce his rights against the data importer; if the data exporter does not take such action within a reasonable period (which under normal circumstances would be one month), the data subject may then enforce his rights against the data importer directly. A data subject is entitled to proceed directly against a data exporter that has failed to use reasonable efforts to determine that the data importer is able to satisfy its legal obligations under these clauses (the data exporter shall have the burden to prove that it took reasonable efforts).

**IV.**  **Law applicable to the clauses**

These clauses shall be governed by the law of the country in which the data exporter is established, with the exception of the laws and regulations relating to processing of the personal data by the data importer under clause II(h), which shall apply only if so selected by the data importer under that clause. In the event of a dispute between the data importer and the data exporter concerning any alleged breach of any provision of these clauses, such dispute shall be finally settled under the rules of arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with the said rules. The place of arbitration shall be New York, US. The number of arbitrators shall be 3.

**V.**  **Resolution of disputes with data subjects or the authority**

1. In the event of a dispute or claim brought by a data subject or the authority concerning the processing of the personal data against either or both of the parties, the parties will inform each other about any such disputes or claims, and will cooperate with a view to settling them amicably in a timely fashion.

1. The parties agree to respond to any generally available non-binding mediation procedure initiated by a data subject or by the authority. If they do participate in the proceedings, the parties may elect to do so remotely (such as by telephone or other electronic means). The parties also agree to consider participating in any other arbitration, mediation or other dispute resolution proceedings developed for data protection disputes.

1. Each party shall abide by a decision of a competent court of the data exporter&#39;s country of establishment or of the authority which is final and against which no further appeal is possible.

**VI.**  **Termination**

1. In the event that the data importer is in breach of its obligations under these clauses, then the data exporter may temporarily suspend the transfer of personal data to the data importer until the breach is repaired or the contract is terminated.

1. In the event that:

(i) the transfer of personal data to the data importer has been temporarily suspended by the data exporter for longer than one month pursuant to paragraph (a);

1. compliance by the data importer with these clauses would put it in breach of its legal or regulatory obligations in the country of import;

1. the data importer is in substantial or persistent breach of any warranties or undertakings given by it under these clauses;

1. a final decision against which no further appeal is possible of a competent court of the data exporter&#39;s country of establishment or of the authority rules that there has been a breach of the clauses by the data importer or the data exporter; or

1. a petition is presented for the administration or winding up of the data importer, whether in its personal or business capacity, which petition is not dismissed within the applicable period for such dismissal under applicable law; a winding up order is made; a receiver is appointed over any of its assets; a trustee in bankruptcy is appointed, if the data importer is an individual; a company voluntary arrangement is commenced by it; or any equivalent event in any jurisdiction occurs

then the data exporter, without prejudice to any other rights which it may have against the data importer, shall be entitled to terminate these clauses, in which case the authority shall be informed where required. In cases covered by (i), (ii), or (iv) above the data importer may also terminate these clauses.

1. Either party may terminate these clauses if (i) any Commission positive adequacy decision under Article 25(6) of Directive 95/46/EC (or any superseding text, i.e. under Article 45 of the GDPR) is issued in relation to the country (or a sector thereof) to which the data is transferred and processed by the data importer, or (ii) Directive 95/46/EC (or any superseding text, i.e. the GDPR) becomes directly applicable in such country.

1. The parties agree that the termination of these clauses at any time, in any circumstances and for whatever reason (except for termination under clause VI(c)) does not exempt them from the obligations and/or conditions under the clauses as regards the processing of the personal data transferred.

**VII.**  **Variation of these clauses**

The parties may not modify these clauses except to update any information in Annex B, in which case they will inform the authority where required. This does not preclude the parties from adding additional commercial clauses where required.

**VIII.**  **Description of the Transfer**

The details of the transfer and of the personal data are specified in Annex B. The parties agree that Annex B may contain confidential business information which they will not disclose to third parties, except as required by law or in response to a competent regulatory or government agency, or as required under clause I(e). The parties may execute additional annexes to cover additional transfers, which will be submitted to the authority where required. Annex B may, in the alternative, be drafted to cover multiple transfers.

**ANNEX A**

**DATA PROCESSING PRINCIPLES**

1. **Purpose limitation:** Personal data may be processed and subsequently used or further communicated only for purposes described in Annex B or subsequently authorised by the data subject.

1. **Data quality and proportionality** : Personal data must be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date. The personal data must be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which they are transferred and further processed.

1. **Transparency:** Data subjects must be provided with information necessary to ensure fair processing (such as information about the purposes of processing and about the transfer), unless such information has already been given by the data exporter.

1. **Security and confidentiality:** Technical and organisational security measures must be taken by the data controller that are appropriate to the risks, such as against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access, presented by the processing. Any person acting under the authority of the data controller, including a processor, must not process the data except on instructions from the data controller.

1. **Rights of access, rectification, deletion and objection:** As provided in Article 12 of Directive 95/46/EC (corresponding Article 15 of the GDPR), data subjects must, whether directly or via a third party, be provided with the personal information about them that an organisation holds, except for requests which are manifestly abusive, based on unreasonable intervals or their number or repetitive or systematic nature, or for which access need not be granted under the law of the country of the data exporter. Provided that the authority has given its prior approval, access need also not be granted when doing so would be likely to seriously harm the interests of the data importer or other organisations dealing with the data importer and such interests are not overridden by the interests for fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject. The sources of the personal data need not be identified when this is not possible by reasonable efforts, or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated. Data subjects must be able to have the personal information about them rectified, amended, or deleted where it is inaccurate or processed against these principles. If there are compelling grounds to doubt the legitimacy of the request, the organisation may require further justifications before proceeding to rectification, amendment or deletion. Notification of any rectification, amendment or deletion to third parties to whom the data have been disclosed need not be made when this involves a disproportionate effort. A data subject must also be able to object to the processing of the personal data relating to him if there are compelling legitimate grounds relating to his particular situation. The burden of proof for any refusal rests on the data importer, and the data subject may always challenge a refusal before the authority.

1. **Sensitive data:** The data importer shall take such additional measures (e.g. relating to security) as are necessary to protect such sensitive data in accordance with its obligations under clause II.

1. **Data used for marketing purposes:** Where data are processed for the purposes of direct marketing, effective procedures should exist allowing the data subject at any time to &quot;opt-out&quot; from having his data used for such purposes.

1. **Automated decisions:** For purposes hereof &quot;automated decision&quot; shall mean a decision by the data exporter or the data importer which produces legal effects concerning a data subject or significantly affects a data subject and which is based solely on automated processing of personal data intended to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to him, such as his performance at work, creditworthiness, reliability, conduct, etc. The data importer shall not make any automated decisions concerning data subjects, except when:

1. (i) such decisions are made by the data importer in entering into or performing a contract with the data subject, and

(ii) the data subject is given an opportunity to discuss the results of a relevant automated decision with a representative of the parties making such decision or otherwise to make representations to that parties.

or

1. where otherwise provided by the law of the data exporter.

The data importer agrees and warrants:

(a) to process the personal data only on behalf of the data exporter and in compliance with its instructions and the Clauses; if it cannot provide such compliance for whatever reasons, it agrees to inform promptly the data exporter of its inability to comply, in which case the data exporter is entitled to suspend the transfer of data and/or terminate the contract;

(b) that it has no reason to believe that the legislation applicable to it prevents it from fulfilling the instructions received from the data exporter and its obligations under the contract and that in the event of a change in this legislation which is likely to have a substantial adverse effect on the warranties and obligations provided by the Clauses, it will promptly notify the change to the data exporter as soon as it is aware, in which case the data exporter is entitled to suspend the transfer of data and/or terminate the contract;

(c) that it has implemented the technical and organisational security measures specified in Appendix 2 before processing the personal data transferred;

(d) that it will promptly notify the data exporter about:

(i) any legally binding request for disclosure of the personal data by a law enforcement authority unless otherwise prohibited, such as a prohibition under criminal law to preserve the confidentiality of a law enforcement investigation,

(ii) any accidental or unauthorised access, and

(iii) any request received directly from the data subjects without responding to that request, unless it has been otherwise authorised to do so;

(e) to deal promptly and properly with all inquiries from the data exporter relating to its processing of the personal data subject to the transfer and to abide by the advice of the supervisory authority with regard to the processing of the data transferred;

(f) at the request of the data exporter to submit its data processing facilities for audit of the processing activities covered by the Clauses which shall be carried out by the data exporter or an inspection body composed of independent members and in possession of the required professional qualifications bound by a duty of confidentiality, selected by the data exporter, where applicable, in agreement with the supervisory authority;

(g) to make available to the data subject upon request a copy of the Clauses, or any existing contract for subprocessing, unless the Clauses or contract contain commercial information, in which case it may remove such commercial information, with the exception of Appendix 2 which shall be replaced by a summary description of the security measures in those cases where the data subject is unable to obtain a copy from the data exporter;

(h) that, in the event of subprocessing, it has previously informed the data exporter and obtained its prior written consent;

(i) that the processing services by the subprocessor will be carried out in accordance with Clause 11;

(j) to send promptly a copy of any subprocessor agreement it concludes under the Clauses to the data exporter.

Clause 6

Liability

1. The parties agree that any data subject, who has suffered damage as a result of any breach of the obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11 by any party or subprocessor is entitled to receive compensation from the data exporter for the damage suffered.

2. If a data subject is not able to bring a claim for compensation in accordance with paragraph 1 against the data exporter, arising out of a breach by the data importer or his subprocessor of any of their obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11, because the data exporter has factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or has become insolvent, the data importer agrees that the data subject may issue a claim against the data importer as if it were the data exporter, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter by contract of by operation of law, in which case the data subject can enforce its rights against such entity.

The data importer may not rely on a breach by a subprocessor of its obligations in order to avoid its own liabilities.

3. If a data subject is not able to bring a claim against the data exporter or the data importer referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, arising out of a breach by the subprocessor of any of their obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11 because both the data exporter and the data importer have factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent, the subprocessor agrees that the data subject may issue a claim against the data subprocessor with regard to its own processing operations under the Clauses as if it were the data exporter or the data importer, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter or data importer by contract or by operation of law, in which case the data subject can enforce its rights against such entity. The liability of the subprocessor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses.

Clause 7

Mediation and jurisdiction

1. The data importer agrees that if the data subject invokes against it third-party beneficiary rights and/or claims compensation for damages under the Clauses, the data importer will accept the decision of the data subject:

(a) to refer the dispute to mediation, by an independent person or, where applicable, by the supervisory authority;

(b) to refer the dispute to the courts in the Member State in which the data exporter is established.

2. The parties agree that the choice made by the data subject will not prejudice its substantive or procedural rights to seek remedies in accordance with other provisions of national or international law.

Clause 8

Cooperation with supervisory authorities

1. The data exporter agrees to deposit a copy of this contract with the supervisory authority if it so requests or if such deposit is required under the applicable data protection law.

2. The parties agree that the supervisory authority has the right to conduct an audit of the data importer, and of any subprocessor, which has the same scope and is subject to the same conditions as would apply to an audit of the data exporter under the applicable data protection law.

3. The data importer shall promptly inform the data exporter about the existence of legislation applicable to it or any subprocessor preventing the conduct of an audit of the data importer, or any subprocessor, pursuant to paragraph 2. In such a case the data exporter shall be entitled to take the measures foreseen in Clause 5 (b).

Clause 9

Governing Law

The Clauses shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established.

Clause 10

Variation of the contract

The parties undertake not to vary or modify the Clauses. This does not preclude the parties from adding clauses on business related issues where required as long as they do not contradict the Clause.

Clause 11

Subprocessing

1. The data importer shall not subcontract any of its processing operations performed on behalf of the data exporter under the Clauses without the prior written consent of the data exporter. Where the data importer subcontracts its obligations under the Clauses, with the consent of the data exporter, it shall do so only by way of a written agreement with the subprocessor which imposes the same obligations on the subprocessor as are imposed on the data importer under the Clauses. Where the subprocessor fails to fulfil its data protection obligations under such written agreement the data importer shall remain fully liable to the data exporter for the performance of the subprocessor&#39;s obligations under such agreement.

2. The prior written contract between the data importer and the subprocessor shall also provide for a third-party beneficiary clause as laid down in Clause 3 for cases where the data subject is not able to bring the claim for compensation referred to in paragraph 1 of Clause 6 against the data exporter or the data importer because they have factually disappeared or have ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent and no successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter or data importer by contract or by operation of law. Such third-party liability of the subprocessor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses.

3. The provisions relating to data protection aspects for subprocessing of the contract referred to in paragraph 1 shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established.

4. The data exporter shall keep a list of subprocessing agreements concluded under the Clauses and notified by the data importer pursuant to Clause 5 (j), which shall be updated at least once a year. The list shall be available to the data exporter&#39;s data protection supervisory authority.

Clause 12

Obligation after the termination of personal data processing services

1. The parties agree that on the termination of the provision of data processing services, the data importer and the subprocessor shall, at the choice of the data exporter, return all the personal data transferred and the copies thereof to the data exporter or shall destroy all the personal data and certify to the data exporter that it has done so, unless legislation imposed upon the data importer prevents it from returning or destroying all or part of the personal data transferred. In that case, the data importer warrants that it will guarantee the confidentiality of the personal data transferred and will not actively process the personal data transferred anymore.

2. The data importer and the subprocessor warrant that upon request of the data exporter and/or of the supervisory authority, it will submit its data processing facilities for an audit of the measures referred to in paragraph 1.
