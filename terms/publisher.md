**PUBLISHER TERMS OF SERVICE &amp; PRIVACY POLICY**

Last updated: November 2023

**WHO WE ARE**

Pollfish, LLC, a California limited liability company, is wholly owned by Prodege, LLC, and has its principal place of business at 1460 Broadway, New York, NY 10036, USA (collectively with our affiliates, "Pollfish," "we," "our" or "us"). Pollfish also has a Greek office located at Pirri 5 Athens, Attica 11527, GR.

Pollfish owns and operates the www.pollfish.com website, and all subdomains and related properties thereof (collectively, the "Website"), and any software, software development kits (“SDKs”), data, and materials accessible via the Website (the "Features"), through which it provides the Services (as defined below) offered in these Publisher Terms of Service and Privacy Policy (the “Agreement”).

**WHO YOU ARE**

You (“Publisher,” "you," or “your”) are the owner/operator/publisher of one or more mobile applications or websites, or other affiliate/mass marketing services (collectively, your “Platform(s)”), with an established audience of end-users (the “User(s)”), that wishes to access the Website, Features, and Services (as defined below) that Pollfish provides.

**INTRODUCTION**

**PART A [Terms of Service]** of the Agreement governs your use of the Website, Features and Services.

**PART B [Privacy Policy]** of the Agreement discloses the ways we process your personal information, the purposes of such processing and your Privacy rights.

**To access the Pollfish Website, Features and Services, you must accept and conform to this Agreement.**

**PART A: TERMS OF SERVICE**

**1. REGISTRATION**

The first step to access and enable Pollfish Services is to register your Platform at https://www.pollfish.com/signup/publisher, including by providing your contact email, password, legal status and VAT (if applicable). You may then download the Pollfish SDK and begin configuring your Publisher dashboard on the Website (the “Dashboard”). To go live, you must request approval from Pollfish via your Dashboard settings. Once approved, Pollfish will assign you an API key for each Platform where you wish to integrate the Services. You can update your registration information at any time.

**2. OUR SERVICES**

Subject to our approval of your Registration request, and your continued compliance with the terms of this Agreement, Pollfish agrees to provide the following services, which allow you to monetize your Platform by receiving Commissions (defined below) for User participation (the "Services"). Pollfish allows you to display in the Platform, and expose your Users to, the content described in this Section 2, including both rewarded and non-rewarded surveys (collectively, “Surveys”), and rewarded video, actionable ads, and magic receipts (collectively, “Offers”).  Generally, each Survey or Offer contains one or more opportunities that Pollfish, or a third-party client of Pollfish (each a “Client”), may wish to extend to your Users, and for which Pollfish may pay you Commission upon a successful Conversion (defined below) by one of your Users:

**2.1 Surveys:** Pollfish operates an on-line survey platform, through which researchers may conduct surveys that solicit answers from respondents (“Respondents”). A participating researcher can create a survey using the Features (or ask Pollfish to do so on their behalf) and target it to a specific Respondent audience of interest. Pollfish then collaborates with publishers to provide access to the users of applications and websites (like the Users of your Platform), who in turn may be incentivized or rewarded for their participation as Respondents in surveys (“Rewarded Surveys”). Pollfish also works with independent survey-research partners ("Mediation Partners") that seek Respondents for their own clients, and that use Pollfish to tender their clients’ surveys ("Mediation Surveys") to Respondents. Not all Surveys that Pollfish provides through the Services are Rewarded Surveys, nor do all Surveys generate Commission (as defined below) for Publisher. For additional details on non-Commission-generating Surveys, see Section 4.1.2 in Part A of this Agreement.

**2.2 Offers:** In addition to Surveys, Pollfish offers a number of rewarded User experiences as part of the Services, including rewarded video, actionable ads, and magic receipts, as follows:

**2.2.1 Rewarded Video:** Pollfish may serve Offers to Publisher containing third party-generated, timed video clips, which feature advertising or other rewarded content (“Rewarded Video”). Users must watch the full video and complete any other requirements imposed by the third-party advertising partner to generate a successful Conversion (defined below).

**2.2.2 Actionable Ads:** Pollfish may serve Offers to Publisher containing third party-administered, advertising content, such as performance-marketing opportunities, featured mobile applications, sponsored web content, and related third-party advertisements (collectively, “Ads”). All such Ads are “actionable,” meaning the User is offered an incentive or reward to act as prompted by the Ad. If the User completes the required actions, Pollfish will recognize a successful Conversion (defined below).

**2.2.3 Magic Receipts:** Pollfish may also serve Offers to Publisher containing online coupons, discounts or other rewards for in-store or online purchases of goods or services from participating third-party merchants and advertising partners (collectively, “Magic Receipts”).  To claim the value of a Magic Receipts coupon or discount, a User need only add the item to their “shopping list” in the Magic Receipts interface and upload a digital image of their receipt for their purchase of the item, once complete. Pollfish will scan and parse the written text on the receipt image (the “Receipt Image”) to extract relevant receipt text identifying the store, item(s) purchased, purchase price, etc. (the “Purchase Data”), as well as any optical, analytical or computational metadata derived therefrom, including fraud-prevention data (the “Receipt Metadata”).  Pollfish will assess the Purchase data to confirm it matches the Magic Receipts Offer in the User’s shopping list and that the Receipt Metadata is consistent with an authentic submission.  If the User submission meets these requirements, Pollfish will recognize a successful Conversion (defined below).

You may individually enable or disable Surveys and/or each Offer category for your Users in the Dashboard.  However, you do not have control over which specific Surveys or Offers are enabled within each category, nor their content.  Therefore, if you choose to enable Surveys for your Users, you may not control which individual Surveys will be served, nor their content; nor would you be able to do so for Rewarded Ads, Rewarded Video, or Magic Receipts, if enabled.

**3. CONVERSIONS**

For purposes of these Terms, a “Conversion” means any discrete end-user action (e.g., a Survey completion, or an impression, click, download, purchase, view, or submission for an Offer) or other event, or series thereof, for which Pollfish agrees to pay some commission to Publisher.  The amount of commission (or revenue share) that Publisher will pay for each successful Conversion varies by Survey or Offer type and in accordance with the activity goal(s) stated in their respective terms, as conveyed to Publisher via the Pollfish Features at the time of Offer Conversion (“Commission”).

The Features contain any relevant graphic and textual media, creative, links, or other materials relating to the Surveys and Offers that Users may need to understand and access the Surveys and Offers (collectively, the “Creative”). By enabling the Pollfish Features, you will establish a link between your Platform and the Pollfish Website and/or the relevant Client sites on which the Survey or Offer is hosted (the “Host Sites”).

For Pollfish to register a successful Conversion resulting in payment of Commission, one person must properly and successfully complete every discrete end-user action or event, or series thereof, stated within the terms of the Creative as required to earn an incentive. For Surveys or Offers with multiple stated goals, a natural person must complete the minimum required actions for at least one of the goals to result in a Conversion.

In addition, for each Conversion to be valid, that natural person must: (i) be a User of the Platform, directly or indirectly, (ii) access any applicable Host Site via the Creative, where the Creative is the last link recorded before the visit to the Host Site, (iii) not be a computer-generated user, such as a robot, spider, or computer script, or employ other automated, artificial or fraudulent methods to appear like a natural person, (iv) not use pre-populated or computer-generated fields or responses, including for Surveys, (v) not employ other tactics indicative of Survey abuse, including straight-lining, speeding, or inappropriate or mismatched responses; and (vi) not later have their actions determined by Pollfish or the Client to be fraudulent, incomplete, unqualified or a duplicate of another User’s. Any User attempting to complete a Survey or Offer by means of non-qualifying, incomplete, inaccurate, untimely, false, or fraudulent methods, signals or submissions (as determined by Pollfish in our sole discretion) will not result in a Conversion, nor entitle Publisher to any Commission from Pollfish. Pollfish may, in its sole discretion, request that Publisher block a User from accessing Pollfish Features and Services due to fraud or abuse, and may withhold payment of relevant Commissions if that User continues to access the Features or Services after such a request.

Publisher will earn Commission from successful Survey and Offer Conversions, which Publisher may in turn share in whole or in part with Users as an incentive or reward for their engagement (as detailed in Section 6 in Part A of this Agreement). Pollfish does not charge any fees or costs for Publishers to integrate Pollfish SDKs or libraries in their applications. However, Publisher is solely responsible for the cost and payment of any incentives or other rewards that you may choose to advertise to Users in connection with Offers on your Platform. Such User rewards may be paid from the Commissions that Pollfish delivers to Publisher for each Conversion, in Publisher’s discretion.

**4. COMMISSIONS**

**4.1 Surveys**

Pollfish offers both Commission-Generating (i.e., rewarded or incentivized) Surveys and non-Commission-Generating Survey types, as detailed below:

**4.1.1 Commission-Generating Survey Types**

Only certain types of Survey Offers generate Commissions for Publisher. Pollfish offers the following types of Commission-generating Surveys:

(i) <ins> Basic Surveys </ins>

When a User completes a Basic Survey resulting in a successful Conversion, Pollfish will pay Publisher a minimum lump sum payment, which currently amounts to approximately USD 0.30. Pollfish reserves the right to change this lump sum payment amount at any time on a prospective basis for all Basic Survey Conversions that follow the change.  No such change will retroactively affect any Basic Survey Conversions that were successfully completed as of the time of the change. No Commission will be delivered to the Publisher for any attempted Conversions of Basic Surveys that are deemed incomplete or unsuccessful by Pollfish, in our sole and absolute discretion.

(ii) <ins> Mediation Surveys </ins>

When a User completes a Mediation Survey resulting in a successful Conversion, Pollfish will pay Publisher a minimum lump sum payment, which currently amounts to approximately USD 0.30. Pollfish reserves the right to change this lump sum payment amount at any time on a prospective basis for any or all Mediation Survey Conversions that follow the change. Pollfish hosts Mediation Surveys via partnerships formed with third-party Mediation Partners.  Accordingly, Mediation Surveys have a different look and feel from Pollfish Surveys and generally launch in an external browser window, after an initial prompt. Publisher, when installing Pollfish, may enable or disable Mediation Surveys through the Pollfish Dashboard without the need for changes in code.

(iii) <ins> Playful Surveys </ins>

Pollfish offers certain Survey content via the Services that is primarily intended to drive User engagement, rather than to serve a research purpose.  We call such content “Playful Surveys.”  When activating Surveys for your Users, you have the option to include Playful Surveys as well, or to restrict them and enable only Basic Surveys.  There is no minimum lump sum payment for Users who complete a Playful Survey, and there may be no Commission associated with such a Conversion.  Any Commission that Pollfish may choose to pay for such a Playful Survey Conversion is purely discretionary and subject to change at any time.

**4.1.2 Non-Commission-Generating Survey Types**

The Pollfish Services also feature the following types of Surveys that do not result in Commission payments to Publisher, but which nevertheless must be enabled if Surveys are offered to your Users (subject to the Publisher control mechanisms specified below):

(i) <ins> Pre-Screeners </ins>

Some Surveys require a pre-screening process to determine if a User meets the researcher’s defined criteria for the core Survey content (a “Pre-screener”). If a User fails to pass the Pre-screener, the User is disqualified from the Survey and no Conversion will result, even if the User has completed the Pre-screener. Pollfish delivers no Commission to Publisher solely for Users’ participation in these mandatory Pre-screeners.

(ii) <ins> Demographic Surveys </ins>

To continuously improve the quality of our Services, and the targeting of relevant Surveys to Users, the first time a User attempts Surveys, Pollfish will display a standalone demographic Survey to the User (a “Demo Survey”). Pollfish does not deliver Commission to Publisher solely for Users’ participation in these standalone Demo Surveys. However, if a Commission-generating Survey for which the User qualifies is available at the time the User completes the Demo Survey, Pollfish will transfer the User directly into the paid Survey content, which may result in Commission upon a successful Conversion.

Publisher has the option to disable standalone Demo Surveys, either using Publisher’s code or the Dashboard. However, due to the importance of the targeting data contained in the Demo Surveys, where Publisher selects this option, Pollfish will instead append the Demo Surveys’ content to the beginning of paid Survey options, as they become available. In that case, Publisher will still only receive Commission for any non-Demo Survey content that results in a successful Conversion.

(iii) <ins> Internal Surveys </ins>

You are permitted to program and offer internal surveys to your Users on the Pollfish Website, solely for purposes of soliciting feedback regarding your Platform and improving the services you provide (“Internal Surveys”).  In addition to your capacity as Publisher under this Agreement, in conducting any such Internal Survey you will also act as Researcher, and as such will be subject to and must comply with the Researcher Terms and Conditions available at https://www.pollfish.com/terms/researcher. Internal Surveys are not transferable to any third party and may only be performed on the specific applications/websites that constitute your Platform and integrate Pollfish Services under this Agreement. Pollfish reserves the right to block any Internal Surveys, in our sole discretion, if we conclude they are being conducted for impermissible purposes, or in breach of this Agreement or Applicable Laws (defined below). Internal Surveys are offered free-of-charge as a courtesy to publishers and we reserve the right to withdraw or modify this feature, including by changing the frequency or number of permitted Internal Surveys, at any time and without prior notice.

**4.2 Rewarded Video Commission**

Pollfish will pay Publisher a variable fee for each successful Rewarded Video Conversion, the amount of which is dynamically relayed to Publisher in the Pollfish SDK. Please note that no minimum lump-sum payment is applicable or payable for Rewarded Video.

**4.3 AdCommission**

Pollfish will pay Publisher a variable fee for each successful Ad Conversion, the amount of which is dynamically relayed to Publisher in the Pollfish SDK. Please note that no minimum lump-sum payment is applicable or payable for Ads.

A User does not generate a successful Conversion for Commission purposes by merely viewing or clicking on an Ad, or otherwise failing to complete all actions required under the Ad terms to the full satisfaction of Pollfish and/or the advertiser.

**4.4 Magic Receipts Commission**

Pollfish will pay Publisher a variable fee for each successful Magic Receipts Conversion, the amount of which will be dynamically relayed to Publisher in the Pollfish SDK via server-to-server callbacks. Please note that no minimum lump-sum is applicable or payable for Magic Receipt.

A User does not generate a successful Conversion for Commission purposes by merely viewing or clicking on any Magic Receipts offer and failing to submit a valid and legible receipt therefor, or by submitting (as determined by Pollfish in our sole discretion) any incomplete, ineligible, non-qualifying, untimely, false, or fraudulent receipt.

**5. PAYMENT TERMS**

(i) Payment of Commissions is dependent upon Clients providing such funds to Pollfish, and therefore, you agree that Pollfish shall only be liable to you for Commissions if and to the extent that Pollfish has received payment from the Client for the related Conversion(s). You hereby release Pollfish from any claim for Commissions if Pollfish has not received such funds from the relevant Client.

(ii) Pollfish will pay Publisher any applicable Commission monthly through the payment systems and methods selected by Pollfish. In our sole discretion, Pollfish may elect to use third-party payment systems and solutions (e.g., hosting entities that offer multiple payment solutions) to process Commission payments (each a “Payment Processor”).  To the extent any Payment Processor(s) and Pollfish support multiple payment methods, you may have the option to select one or more preferred payment method(s) to receive Commission relating to the Services. Publisher agrees to cooperate with and abide by the terms and conditions of any applicable payment methods for the Payment Processors selected by Pollfish. If Publisher declines to accept any of the payment requirements, rules, terms or conditions of Pollfish or the Payment Processors, or declines to accept Commission payments therefrom, Pollfish will neither owe nor pay any Commission to Publisher for Conversions during the applicable period.

(iii) Pollfish, at the request of any Payment Processor, may require Publisher to provide any information deemed necessary by the Payment Processor for compliance with applicable National, State or Federal laws or banking regulations (e.g., laws concerning foreign asset controls, or other similar procedures prescribed by law) to effectuate the Commission payments.  Publisher will provide such information either directly to the Payment Processor or indirectly via Pollfish, as required. By accepting this Agreement, you specifically agree to cooperate fully in any such request.

(iv) Publisher (and not Pollfish) is responsible for all taxes, VAT, fees, commissions and other transaction costs (registration, banking, ACH transfer, credit or debit charges, etc.) (collectively, “Costs”) that the Payment Processor may impose for the transmission or receipt of Commissions via your preferred payment method. You, the Publisher, are responsible for any and all Costs and acknowledge and agree that Pollfish and/or the Payment Processor may deduct Costs from the sum payable to you by Pollfish.

(v) You agree that, before initiating the use of our Services or agreeing to any available Payment Processor or payment method option, you will investigate and familiarize yourself with the applicable terms of service, including third-party commission rates or Costs that may impact your Commission. To the extent Pollfish provides information in the Features or Services about applicable Costs for a given Payment Processor or method, it is for comparison purposes only and Pollfish does not represent or warrant that such information is or will remain accurate over time. Moreover, Pollfish expressly cautions that such information may be subject to revision at any time in Payment Processor’s sole discretion and without notice to Publisher.

(vi) Pollfish, LLC is registered in the US. All Publisher payments are made in US dollars (USD). Any notifications or listeners that the SDK may fire within the Platform to inform Users about monetary rewards they may earn from Offers will be denominated in USD.

(vii) Payments are made within a two-week time frame (Net14) from the 1st day of each calendar month. The minimum Commission amount required to initiate a monthly payment is USD$30.  If the amount of Commission outstanding in any given month is less than USD$30, the payment will be withheld until the following month, or until the amount reaches or exceeds the minimum threshold of USD$30.

(viii) Commission amounts, timing and payment methods may change at any time without prior notice. However, any such changes will not affect the amount of Commission payable for any past or ongoing Conversions; they will apply only to subsequent Conversion actions.

(ix) In addition to and consistent with the terms of Section 3 above, Pollfish shall not be obligated to make any Commission payments to Publisher for Rejected Surveys (as defined below) or Rejected Conversions (as also defined below). “Rejected Surveys” means: (a) incomplete Surveys; (b) invalid Surveys; (c) Survey completes generated by fraudulent action or in violation of these Terms and/or applicable law, as determined in Pollfish’s sole discretion; and/or (d) Survey completes rejected as unacceptable by Pollfish’s Clients (including Mediation Partners), in their sole discretion. “Rejected Conversions” means any attempted Conversions on Rewarded Video, Ads or Magic Receipts that are rejected because they are: (a) generated by fraudulent action or in violation of the terms of this Agreement and/or applicable law, as determined in Pollfish’s sole discretion; and/or (b) deemed unacceptable or incomplete by Pollfish’s Clients, in their sole discretion.

(x) Pollfish uses industry-standard server-to-server (“S2S”) callbacks to provide Publisher a monitoring tool in the Dashboard that Publisher may use to track Rejected Surveys and Rejected Conversions, including statistical data where applicable. Pollfish will notify Publisher of Rejected Surveys or Rejected Conversions via the monitoring tool, and all such determinations will be final and binding for the Publisher. Publisher agrees to forfeit and allow Pollfish to offset--and deduct from future Commissions--any amounts due for Rejected Surveys or Rejected Conversions, including those that Publisher has already received Commission for.

(xi) Publisher’s Commissions will be calculated based on the verified Survey, Ads, Rewarded Video and Magic Receipts Conversions reported to Publisher via S2S callbacks. However, Pollfish continuously monitors User and Platform activity to detect, identify and prevent server errors, fraud, misrepresentation, and any other violation of the Pollfish terms of service that may affect Conversions (collectively, “Integrity Checks”). Pollfish reserves the right to withhold payment of Commission for any Surveys or Conversions that fail the Integrity Checks, even if otherwise logged in S2S callbacks, whenever the Integrity Checks detect issues affecting the validity of any attempted Conversion.

**6. USER INCENTIVISATION**

(i) You may choose to incentivize Users in any way you wish to complete Surveys or Offers, including through the offer of monetary rewards, provided you comply with Applicable Laws. Pollfish recommends that Publisher use the verified Survey and Offer Conversions reported by our callbacks to calculate these incentives, as Pollfish will not make any payments which deviate from our S2S reports. To further ensure the accuracy of the S2S reporting, Pollfish recommends using all suggested parameters from the Dashboard and Services documentation in your callback url for Conversions. Please note that some Survey and Offer Conversions may not appear in real time, or may be subsequently modified or withdrawn pursuant to Pollfish’s Integrity Checks.

(ii) The Pollfish S2S reporting option is available on the Dashboard. Pollfish cannot and does not guarantee that the S2S callback system described herein will be free of system errors or user fraud, and Pollfish accepts no responsibility or liability for any losses incurred by Publisher due to errors in the S2S report. However, Pollfish shall promptly inform the Publisher about any errors it detects that could affect Publisher’s reporting.

**7. REFERRAL PROGRAM**

Pollfish has a referral program in place, through which Publisher may introduce Pollfish to other publishers. Publisher may receive additional earnings from successful use of the referral program, as further detailed at https://www.pollfish.com/referral. For referral earnings, the same general payment terms apply as are described above in Section 5 of this Agreement for Commissions. Misuse of the Pollfish referral program is strictly prohibited, as further detailed in Section 8.3 of Part A of this Agreement.

**8.2 Privacy and Compliance**

(iii) Your Platform complies with all further applicable laws (IP laws and regulations, laws on protection of minors, etc.) (collectively, with Privacy Laws and Data Protection Laws, the “Applicable Laws”) and (if uploaded to the relevant stores) the policies and requirements of Google Android and/or Apple iOS systems and app stores (“App Requirements”).

(iv) You acknowledge and agree that you are and will remain solely responsible for conforming your Platform to all Applicable Laws and requirements. Pollfish shall not be held liable for any damage, including any loss or revenue that you may incur as a result of any ban, suspension or other related penalty imposed on your Platform by any regulator or third party, including the Google or Apple app stores, as a result of your use of Pollfish Features, SDKs, software or other Pollfish client libraries.

(v) If applicable, you will provide all notices required by the CCPA, including a link by which a User may opt out of any sales of his or her personal information; you must specifically notify Users that they may withdraw their consent and opt-out from personalized ad tracking and ad-tendering by using their mobile platform settings [currently, on iOS, by enabling the "Limit Ad Tracking" setting (iOS version 13 and earlier only) or by disabling the "Allow Apps to Request to Track" setting (iOS version 14 and later only), and on Android devices, by enabling the "Opt out of Ads Personalization" setting; or such settings as may be available in any future release].

However, you are permitted to work with other, compatible online advertising networks on your Platform, provided they comply with Applicable Laws and App Requirements.

(vii) Pollfish does not direct our Services to children under the age of 16. You represent and warrant that your Platform is not directed to children under the age of 16 either; and that you comply (and will comply throughout the Term) with the U.S. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"). You will also provide relevant information in your Privacy Policy to all Users relating to the privacy rights of minors under Applicable Laws.

You will make commercially reasonable efforts to identify the age of your Users and refrain from collecting information from children under the age of 16. You will not knowingly share the data of any Users under the age of 16 with Pollfish. If Pollfish detects any User is under the age of 16, Pollfish will promptly block that User from our Services.

(viii) You will prominently post and make available to Users all material terms and conditions relating to each Offer that you feature on behalf of Pollfish or a Client, as required by Applicable Laws. At a minimum, such terms and conditions must include all material requirements for the User to achieve a Conversion.

(ix) As a U.S. Government contractor, Pollfish complies with Section 889 of the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (the “Act”), which restricts our ability to contract with or use certain Chinese telecommunications equipment or services in light of U.S. national security concerns. For purposes of the Act, "covered telecommunications equipment or services" include any handheld communications devices, such as tablets and mobile phones, produced or provided by Huawei Technologies Company, ZTE Corporation or any of their subsidiaries or affiliates. Pollfish takes steps to avoid the intentional targeting of any “covered telecommunications equipment or services” in the provision of our Services.

In using the Website, Features and Services, including all Surveys of Users, you are prohibited from intentionally targeting any “covered telecommunications equipment or services,” as defined under the Act. This includes, but is not limited to, intentionally interfering with or modifying Pollfish’s own measures for compliance with the Act.  If you discover any intentional tampering with the Pollfish targeting system involving your Platform during the Term, you must immediately report it to legal@prodege.com. Incidental contact with a "covered telecommunications equipment or service"—not intentionally targeted by Publisher or your agents—does not require reporting.

(x) In addition to constituting a breach of this Agreement, entitling Pollfish to all remedies associated therewith, any breach of the warranties in this subsection shall also entitle Pollfish to immediately block your Platform from accessing all Services.

**8.3 Account Security**

(i) You will not introduce, and will ensure no third parties using your Platform introduce, any viruses, worms, harmful code and/or Trojan horses on or via our Website, Features or Services;

(ii) You will use different API keys for each different Platform you register with Pollfish, for better profiling of the User base. You shall use only one API key per Platform registered with the Website and Services. You shall operate only one account on the Website. Any attempt to bypass this obligation in order to take advantage of the Pollfish referral scheme via referring one account to another account operated by the same Publisher shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement and entitle Pollfish to suspend or terminate this Agreement, or any of your affiliated accounts, and/or to seek to recover or offset any relevant damages from any payment that is due, in addition to any other remedies available under Applicable Laws.

(iii) You further acknowledge that you will control your account and API keys and that you are liable for any unlawful act that occurring under your account. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password, account information and API keys, and for restricting access to your computer so that others may not access any password protected portion of the Website, Features or Services using your name, username, or password, in whole or in part. You take full responsibility for all actions and activities performed through your account. You must inform Pollfish immediately of any unauthorized use of your account or any breach of security. Pollfish staff may login to your account from time to time for maintenance and assistance purposes.

(iv) You will abstain from any misuse of our Website, Features or Services and not engage in any fraudulent or deceptive activity in using them, including any fraudulent or deceptive activity aimed at improperly gaining any direct or indirect profit, benefit or advantage from available Pollfish incentives, Offers, referral bonuses or other benefits that may exist from time to time. Misuse of the Website, Features or Services, and/or any fraudulent or deceptive activity, as defined above, shall include (but is not limited to) acts of virtual impersonation of allegedly different account operators, referral of one account to another account operated by the same Publisher (in order to take advantage of the Pollfish referral scheme), use of proxies, VPNs or any external machine routing methods to impersonate or spoof any connection, taking advantage of any possible bug or similar coding errors which may alter or misdirect calculation of payments due from Pollfish, or the use of methodologies such as bots, click farms, VPN connections, or artificial intelligence to generate virtual or falsified Survey answers, Survey or Offer Conversions or Commissions.

(v) You will implement and maintain full end-to-end encryption between the Pollfish Features and your Platform and between your Platform and any Network Affiliates (if applicable) in order to prevent end-link hacks or other security vulnerabilities (“ghost completes”). Publisher bears the risk of any lost Commissions resulting from the failure to maintain full end-to-end encryption in any communications relating to the Services.

(vi) Without limiting any other remedies Pollfish may be entitled to under Applicable Laws, upon any violations of this subsection, Pollfish may, in our discretion, immediately block any further use of Pollfish Services, disable any fraudulent account, recall all possible Offers, benefits and bonuses which the perpetrator(s) may have received and demand the perpetrator(s) immediately compensate Pollfish for any damages, harm or loss of profit caused by such actions.

**9. INSPECTION RIGHTS OF POLLFISH**

Pollfish may at any time request information needed to verify your Platform is as represented during the Registration process and that it follows basic industry standards with respect to its operation, management, security, traffic quality and traffic-generation practices (the "Inspection Process"). Your compliance throughout any Inspection Process is essential to: (i) ensure the quality of User-data transmitted to Pollfish via the Publisher’s app, (ii) ensure compliance with our terms, and (iii) protect our service from fraudulent and deceptive activity (including but not limited to generation of virtual or falsified visitor traffic, Survey responses, or Offer Conversions). You agree to provide only true and accurate information during any Inspection Process.

Publisher may be required to join a conference call with Pollfish, during which you may be asked to demonstrate aspects of your Inspection Process responses in real time (such as through a screen-sharing demonstration).

You may not remove any proprietary labels, text, trademarks, graphics or other marks from Pollfish products or services.

(iii) You may not copy, alter, modify, manipulate or create derivative works of the Features or any Pollfish or Client documentation, graphics, Creative, copy or other materials owned by, or licensed to, Pollfish in any way.

(iv) You derive no rights whatsoever with respect to the Survey or Offer content or the Creative from this Agreement (other than to enable or disable it in your Dashboard), the data collected through our Services (except as expressly set forth in Section 11 of this Part A) or any rewards offered directly to Users by Pollfish or any third party on a Host Site or any site other than the Platform.

We may revoke your license at any time and with immediate effect by giving you written notice.

**11. USER DATA COLLECTED BY POLLFISH**

(i) Our Privacy Policy for Users, available at https://www.pollfish.com/terms/respondent, identifies the data we collect from Users of your Platform. That Privacy Policy is incorporated by reference and forms an essential part of PART A of this Agreement.  You will make all necessary representations in your Platform’s terms of service and privacy policies to ensure that Users of your Platform are aware of and consent to your sharing of User data with Pollfish in accordance with Applicable Laws. You are responsible for ensuring that your notices and disclosures to Users regarding the Services are consistent with its terms.

By accepting this Agreement, you give your consent for Pollfish to collect, use, process and share with third parties any data pertaining to Users’ interaction with Pollfish Surveys and Offers, and you warrant that such collection is fully compatible with your Platform's privacy policy and terms of use (as amended, pursuant to Section 11(vi) of Part A of this Agreement). You are notified that Pollfish may disclose or transfer your User data to a third-party data controller located outside the European Economic Area (EEA), without need for additional, specific notification to the Publisher for each such transfer.

For your Users located in the EEA, any data sharing with Pollfish will be subject to a lawful Data Privacy Framework (DPF) certification, if applicable, or the Standard Contractual Terms (Controller to Controller) included in Appendix A, of this Agreement. For your Users located in the UK, any data sharing with Pollfish will be subject to a DPF certification, if applicable, or governed by the International Data Transfer Addendum to the Standard Contractual Terms included in Appendix B, of this Agreement.

(ii) For certain Offers (but not Surveys), we may require Users to verify their identity for security purposes, including by providing a phone number for SMS authentication. Before the User accesses such an Offer, Pollfish may request that the User voluntarily provide a mobile phone number. If the User consents, they will be sent an SMS text containing a unique code, which they will be asked to provide. If the User declines to provide a mobile phone number, they will be refused access to the Offer. We may rely on third-party service providers to complete the verification but do not sell or share Users’ phone numbers or use them for any purpose other than verification.

(iii) If the User has blocked or opted out from the processing of certain personal data by means of the Platform’s privacy policies, opt-outs and consent mechanisms, Pollfish will collect and process only data provided to Pollfish in compliance with the above-mentioned policies and applicable User consent. Should any User opt out from or deny consent for Pollfish to use or disclosure data required for the Services, this may prevent the effective provision of Survey or Offer opportunities to those Users.

(iv) Pollfish also operates as a survey mediation platform exposing apps and websites to a broader market-research monetization marketplace. More info can be found at https://www.pollfish.com/docs/mediation. Publisher has the option to enable or disable any Survey provider they wish in the Dashboard.  Should you choose to expose your Users to Mediation Surveys, third-party Mediation Partners may collect and process additional User Data, subject to and in accordance with their own terms of use and privacy policies.

(v) For Rewarded Video, Ads or Magic Receipts Offers served to your Platform by Pollfish, third-party advertisers may also collect, in accordance with their terms of use and privacy policies, any User data that such Users provide them directly in interacting with such Offers.

(vi) In addition to the requirements under Section 8.2, and any more user-protective requirements under Applicable Law, you agree to update the public-facing privacy policy for your Platform(s) to include one or both of the following express disclosures (as applicable based on Platform type):

(i) where it has obtained the data subject&#39;s prior consent;

(ii )where necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims in the context of specific administrative, regulatory or judicial proceedings; or

(c) On request, the Parties shall make a copy of these Clauses, including the Appendix as completed by them, available to the data subject free of charge. To the extent necessary to protect business secrets or other confidential information, including personal data, the Parties may redact part of the text of the Appendix prior to sharing a copy, but shall provide a meaningful summary where the data subject would otherwise not be able to understand its content or exercise his/her rights. On request, the Parties shall provide the data subject with the reasons for the redactions, to the extent possible without revealing the redacted information.

In assessing the appropriate level of security, they shall take due account of the state of the art, the costs of implementation, the nature, scope, context and purpose(s) of processing and the risks involved in the processing for the data subject. The Parties shall in particular consider having recourse to encryption or pseudonymisation, including during transmission, where the purpose of processing can be fulfilled in that manner.

(b) The Parties have agreed on the technical and organisational measures set out in Annex II. The data importer shall carry out regular checks to ensure that these measures continue to provide an appropriate level of security.

(c) The data importer shall ensure that persons authorised to process the personal data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality.

In the latter case, the data importer shall instead issue a public communication or take a similar measure to inform the public of the personal data breach.

(g) The data importer shall document all relevant facts relating to the personal data breach, including its effects and any remedial action taken, and keep a record thereof.

(iv) it is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims in the context of specific administrative, regulatory or judicial proceedings;(v)it is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person; or(vi)where none of the other conditions apply, the data importer has obtained the explicit consent of the data subject for an onward transfer in a specific situation, after having informed him/her of its purpose(s), the identity of the recipient and the possible risks of such transfer to him/her due to the lack of appropriate data protection safeguards. In this case, the data importer shall inform the data exporter and, at the request of the latter, shall transmit to it a copy of the information provided to the data subject.

SECTION III – LOCAL LAWS AND OBLIGATIONS IN CASE OF ACCESS BY PUBLIC AUTHORITIES

Clause 13

Local laws and practices affecting compliance with the Clauses

(a) The Parties warrant that they have no reason to believe that the laws and practices in the third country of destination applicable to the processing of the personal data by the data importer, including any requirements to disclose personal data or measures authorising access by public authorities, prevent the data importer from fulfilling its obligations under these Clauses. This is based on the understanding that laws and practices that respect the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms and do not exceed what is necessary and proportionate in a democratic society to safeguard one of the objectives listed in Article 23(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, are not in contradiction with these Clauses.

(b) The Parties declare that in providing the warranty in paragraph (a), they have taken due account in particular of the following elements:

(i) the specific circumstances of the transfer, including the length of the processing chain, the number of actors involved and the transmission channels used; intended onward transfers; the type of recipient; the purpose of processing; the categories and format of the transferred personal data; the economic sector in which the transfer occurs; the storage location of the data transferred;

(ii) the laws and practices of the third country of destination– including those requiring the disclosure of data to public authorities or authorising access by such authorities – relevant in light of the specific circumstances of the transfer, and the applicable limitations and safeguards;

(iii) any relevant contractual, technical or organisational safeguards put in place to supplement the safeguards under these Clauses, including measures applied during transmission and to the processing of the personal data in the country of destination.

(c) The data importer warrants that, in carrying out the assessment under paragraph (b), it has made its best efforts to provide the data exporter with relevant information and agrees that it will continue to cooperate with the data exporter in ensuring compliance with these Clauses.

(d) The Parties agree to document the assessment under paragraph (b) and make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.

(e) The data importer agrees to notify the data exporter promptly if, after having agreed to these Clauses and for the duration of the contract, it has reason to believe that it is or has become subject to laws or practices not in line with the requirements under paragraph (a), including following a change in the laws of the third country or a measure (such as a disclosure request) indicating an application of such laws in practice that is not in line with the requirements in paragraph (a). 

(f) Following a notification pursuant to paragraph (e), or if the data exporter otherwise has reason to believe that the data importer can no longer fulfil its obligations under these Clauses, the data exporter shall promptly identify appropriate measures (e.g. technical or organisational measures to ensure security and confidentiality) to be adopted by the data exporter and/or data importer to address the situation. The data exporter shall suspend the data transfer if it considers that no appropriate safeguards for such transfer can be ensured, or if instructed the competent supervisory authority to do so. In this case, the data exporter shall be entitled to terminate the contract, insofar as it concerns the processing of personal data under these Clauses. If the contract involves more than two Parties, the data exporter may exercise this right to termination only with respect to the relevant Party, unless the Parties have agreed otherwise. Where the contract is terminated pursuant to this Clause, Clause 15 (d) and (e) shall apply.

Clause 14

Obligations of the data importer in case of access by public authorities

14.1 Notification

(a) The data importer agrees to notify the data exporter and, where possible, the data subject promptly (if necessary with the help of the data exporter) if it:

(i) receives a legally binding request from a public authority, including judicial authorities, under the laws of the country of destination for the disclosure of personal data transferred pursuant to these Clauses; such notification shall include information about the personal data requested, the requesting authority, the legal basis for the request and the response provided; or

(ii) becomes aware of any direct access by public authorities to personal data transferred pursuant to these Clauses in accordance with the laws of the country of destination; such notification shall include all information available to the importer.

(b) If the data importer is prohibited from notifying the data exporter and/or the data subject under the laws of the country of destination, the data importer agrees to use its best efforts to obtain a waiver of the prohibition, with a view to communicating as much information as possible, as soon as possible. The data importer agrees to document its best efforts in order to be able to demonstrate them on request of the data exporter.

(c) Where permissible under the laws of the country of destination, the data importer agrees to provide the data exporter, at regular intervals for the duration of the contract, with as much relevant information as possible on the requests received (in particular, number of requests, type of data requested, requesting authority/ies, whether requests have been challenged and the outcome of such challenges, etc.).

(d) The data importer agrees to preserve the information pursuant to paragraphs (a) to (c) for the duration of the contract and make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.

(e) Paragraphs (a) to (c) are without prejudice to the obligation of the data importer pursuant to Clause 13(e) and Clause 15 to inform the data exporter promptly where it is unable to comply with these Clauses.

14.2 Review of legality and data minimisation

(a) The data importer agrees to review the legality of the request for disclosure, in particular whether it remains within the powers granted to the requesting public authority, and to challenge the request if, after careful assessment, it concludes that there are reasonable grounds to consider that the request is unlawful under the laws of the country of destination, applicable obligations under international law and principles of international comity. The data importer shall, under the same conditions, pursue possibilities of appeal. When challenging a request, the data importer shall seek interim measures with a view to suspending the effects of the request until the competent judicial authority has decided on its merits. It shall not disclose the personal data requested until required to do so under the applicable procedural rules. These requirements are without prejudice to the obligations of the data importer under Clause 13(e).

(b) The data importer agrees to document its legal assessment and any challenge to the request for disclosure and, to the extent permissible under the laws of the country of destination, make the documentation available to the data exporter. It shall also make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request. 

(c) The data importer agrees to provide the minimum amount of information permissible when responding to a request for disclosure, based on a reasonable interpretation of the request.

SECTION IV – FINAL PROVISIONS

Clause 15

Non-compliance with the Clauses and termination

(a) The data importer shall promptly inform the data exporter if it is unable to comply with these Clauses, for whatever reason.

(b) In the event that the data importer is in breach of these Clauses or unable to comply with these Clauses, the data exporter shall suspend the transfer of personal data to the data importer until compliance is again ensured or the contract is terminated. This is without prejudice to Clause 13(f).

(c) The data exporter shall be entitled to terminate the contract, insofar as it concerns the processing of personal data under these Clauses, where:

(i) the data exporter has suspended the transfer of personal data to the data importer pursuant to paragraph (b) and compliance with these Clauses is not restored within a reasonable time and in any event within one month of suspension;

(ii) the data importer is in substantial or persistent breach of these Clauses; or

(iii) the data importer fails to comply with a binding decision of a competent court or supervisory authority regarding its obligations under these Clauses.

In these cases, it shall inform the competent supervisory authority of such non- compliance. Where the contract involves more than two Parties, the data exporter may exercise this right to termination only with respect to the relevant Party, unless the Parties have agreed otherwise.

(d) Personal data that has been transferred prior to the termination of the contract pursuant to paragraph (c) shall at the choice of the data exporter immediately be returned to the data exporter or deleted in its entirety. The same shall apply to any copies of the data. The data importer shall certify the deletion of the data to the data exporter. Until the data is deleted or returned, the data importer shall continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses. In case of local laws applicable to the data importer that prohibit the return or deletion of the transferred personal data, the data importer warrants that it will continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses and will only process the data to the extent and for as long as required under that local law.

(e) Either Party may revoke its agreement to be bound by these Clauses where (i) the European Commission adopts a decision pursuant to Article 45(3) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 that covers the transfer of personal data to which these Clauses apply; or (ii) Regulation (EU) 2016/679 becomes part of the legal framework of the country to which the personal data is transferred. This is without prejudice to other obligations applying to the processing in question under Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
