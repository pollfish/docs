Pollfish Inc. (&quot;Pollfish&quot; or &quot;we&quot; &quot;our&quot; or &quot;us&quot;) owns and controls Pollfish services, and provides access to the Pollfish.com website, at the url: www.pollfish.com and all subdomains under the pollfish.com domain and related properties (the &quot;Website&quot;), software, data and materials accessed via the Website (the &quot;Services&quot; or &quot;Properties&quot;).

**THIS AGREEMENT**

**PART A [Terms of Service]** of this Publisher Terms of Service and Privacy Policy (this &quot;Agreement&quot;) governs your use of the Pollfish Website and Services as made available to you by Pollfish.

**PART B [Privacy Policy]** of this Agreement discloses the ways we process your personal information, the purposes of processing and your Privacy rights.

**In order to access the Pollfish Website and Service you are requested to accept and conform to this Agreement, otherwise you will not have access to our Services.**

**PART A: TERMS OF SERVICE**

**1. OUR SERVICE- GENERAL**

Pollfish is an on-line survey platform (&quot;The Service&quot;), through which Researchers may conduct surveys. By registering to Pollfish, the researcher has the opportunity to create a questionnaire (or ask Pollfish to create a questionnaire for him) and address the questionnaire to the specific public he targets. Pollfish collaborates with Publishers of applications for smartphones and/or Website owners (collectively hereinafter referred to as Publisher(s) or &quot;you&quot;) in order to have access to users of these applications and websites. By integrating Pollfish SDK/libraries to their platform/websites and thus exposing their users to Pollfish surveys, Publishers gain revenue for each completed survey. Pollfish does not charge Publishers, who decide to integrate Pollfish SDK/libraries in their applications, with any costs.

**1.1 OUR SERVICE: REVENUE GENERATING TYPES OF SURVEYS**

The following type of revenue generating surveys may be conducted on the Pollfish platform:

**(a) Basic Surveys**

When a Basic Survey is conducted, Pollfish pays to the Publishers who register Pollfish in their application/website, a minimum lump sum of approximately $0,30, for each completed survey/questionnaire. This lump sum may change at any time, but any such change shall not apply to running or completed surveys but only to future ones. If the survey/questionnaire is not completed or is not valid for any reason, no revenue will be delivered to the Publisher.

**(b) Playful Surveys**

When a Playful Survey is conducted, the payment of a fee may vary depending on the extent of the research. The minimum lump sum fee described above does not apply in this case. However, the Publisher, when installing Pollfish, may disable the Playful Surveys option and accept to adhere only for Basic Surveys.

**(c) 3rd Party Surveys (Pollfish Mediation)**

When a 3rd Party Survey is conducted through Pollfish Mediation, Pollfish pays to the Publishers who register Pollfish in their application/website, a minimum lump sum of approximately $0,30, for each completed survey/questionnaire. These surveys arrive to Pollfish via partnerships formed with other 3rd Party Survey providers. 3rd Party Surveys have a different look and feel from Pollfish Basic and Playful surveys (they do not follow the Pollfish mobile design) and are launched in an external browser most of the times outside of the context of the app, after an initial prompt. However, the Publisher, when installing Pollfish, may enable or disable 3rd party surveys from different providers through Pollfish Dashboard without the need for changes in code.

**1.2 OUR SERVICE: NON-REVENUE GENERATING TYPES OF SURVEYS**

The following types of non-revenue generating surveys are also conducted on the Pollfish Platform:

**(a) Screening process surveys:**

Some surveys require a screening process to detect if a mobile user/website visitor is eligible for taking a survey. If a user fails to pass the screening process then the survey is considered as not completed and no revenue will be delivered to the Publisher.

**(b) Demographic information surveys:**

In order to constantly improve Pollfish platform, and make sure that app users are targeted for surveys that would be relevant to them, when a user is first introduced to the platform a standalone demographic survey will be shown. This survey returns no payment to app Publishers, as it is part of the process users need to go through in order for Pollfish to deduct whether they are eligible for survey tendering. Bear in mind that if a paid survey is available at that point, the demographic questions will be inserted at the beginning of the paying survey, before the actual survey questions. In this process, Publishers have full control, in the sense that Publishers can decide whether their users are served demographic standalone surveys or not in two ways: either in code or through the Pollfish Developer Dashboard. If a Publisher chooses to disable demographic standalone surveys, these surveys will be inserted at the beginning of paid party surveys, when available.

**1.3 OUR SERVICE: PAYMENT TERMS**

(i) Publishers get paid on a monthly base through the payment system and payment channel determined by Pollfish or other agreed method (if such a special agreement is concluded between Pollfish and app-Publisher). Pollfish may use the services of third-party payment systems and solutions (e.g. multi-payment solution hosting entities) in order to effect payments and therefore, Publishers shall be requested to provide their consent, cooperate and abide by the terms and conditions of such third-party entities. If the Publisher declines to accept the rules and terms and conditions of such third-party payment systems, no payment can or shall be able to be effected by Pollfish to the declining Publisher.

(ii) Pollfish, at the request of such third-party entity which shall be responsible to effect payments, may disclose information about you to such third party or may request you to provide all further necessary identifying information about you either to Pollfish or directly to such third-party entity, for purposes of compliance with National, State or Federal laws (e.g. laws concerning foreign asset controls, or other similar procedures prescribed by law). By accepting this Agreement you specifically agree to the above and accept that you shall fully cooperate with Pollfish or such third-party entity, for the reasons stated above.

(iii) Please bear in mind that you (and not Pollfish) are responsible for bearing and paying all requested possible commissions or other transaction costs (banking costs, credit, debit charges etc.), as may be requested by the third-party payment system appointed by Pollfish to effect payments and depending on your preferred payment method. You, the Publisher are also responsible for paying all relevant taxes or fees that may arise from payments and transactions. You acknowledge that all and any aforementioned costs (e.g. commission fees) shall be deducted from the sum payable to you by Pollfish, according to the terms of such third party payment systems (and depending on your preferred method of payment), for which you are so notified when using the relevant third party payment service and/or visiting the account section on the Pollfish Publisher Dashboard.

(iv) Before you start using our Services and calculating your revenues from the use of the Pollfish platform, please check the terms of service of such third-party systems in order to get informed about third party commission rates or other possible costs leading to certain deductions from your final payments. We also note that Publishers may at all times visit their account section on the Pollfish Publisher Dashboard and state their preferred payment method. Costs and fees deducted from their payment, are analytically indicated therein, based on the Publisher&#39;s preferred payment method.

(v) Pollfish, may, from time to time, request from you (the Publisher) to provide information about your app/website, in order for Pollfish to be able to verify compliance of your app with the terms and conditions of this agreement and in order to verify the sincerity of your registered info and actual operation of your registered app/website. In case you fail to deliver the verification-information requested by Pollfish, Pollfish shall have the right to withhold all due payments until the requested verification information is provided by you.

(vi) Payments are made within a two weeks&#39; time frame (Net14), commencing always after the 1st day of each calendar month. For Publishers generating more than $10.000 (&amp;gt;$10k) payments shall be made within a forty-five days&#39; time frame (Net45) commencing always after the 1st day of each calendar month. If the amount to be paid is less than $30, the payment will be withheld and transferred to the next month, until the amount reaches or exceeds the amount of $30.

(vii) Publishers or Networks that use Pollfish with an API integration and not with the standard SDK integration will be paid in Net45. All Referral prices are displayed in USD and may be found in [https://www.pollfish.com/referral](https://www.pollfish.com/referral). Polllfish Inc. is a registered US company. All Publisher payments occur in US currency. Notifications/listeners fired from the SDK within the apps to inform the user about the money to be earned from a survey, are delivered in USD.

(viii) Pricing, timing and methods of payments may change at any time without prior notice. However, such change will not affect the minimum price of ongoing services; it will apply from the next survey. Pollfish seeks long term relationships with app Publishers. Consequently, if you chose to delete or otherwise stop the operation of your registered app/website, you agree and acknowledge that Pollfish shall not proceed to any payment of fees referring to the time period between the last payment you received from Pollfish and the date of deletion of your app/website.

**1.4 OUR SERVICE: USER INCENTIVISATION**

(i) If you decide to set money rewards in order to incentivize your user to complete surveys, please have the following in mind: Calculation of Publisher fees and related payments made by Pollfish to the Publisher, are based on the completed survey reports, as reported to Pollfish through the server-to-server callbacks. However, please note that Pollfish reserves the right not to proceed to payments even if they initially correspond to the number and amount of completed surveys as reported through server-to-server callbacks, at all cases where the monitoring checks of Pollfish detect, retrospectively, misrepresentation in relation to completed surveys, due to system errors or due to fraudulent activity (e.g. false impersonation of user responses).

(ii) Server-to-server callbacks, being the standard industry practice for implementing user-rewarding policies in monetization networks, is also the suggested way to reward your own users in case you decide to do so. Other reports or analytics you may be collecting run the risk of being more vulnerable to user fraud, false code implementation, false counting of analytics and several other errors. Therefore, calculation of due payments owed to your own users, as a result of a money rewarding policy set by you in order to incentivize your app users, should be based on the completed survey reports, as reported by our servers through the secure callbacks. Furthermore, in order to be sure about the integrity and uniqueness of the completed surveys as reported, you should be using all suggested arguments in your callback url. In case you choose not to implement Pollfish&#39;s server-to-server callbacks, please bear in mind that Pollfish shall not proceed to any payments which deviate from server-to-server callbacks reports.

(iii) Pollfish server to server option is available on the Pollfish dashboard and can be used at your convenience. However, Pollfish cannot and does not guarantee that the server-to-server callback system as described above shall be invulnerable from system errors or user fraud. Pollfish accepts no responsibility and cannot be held liable for any loss of money suffered by the Publisher due to reporting faults stemming from system errors or user fraud but shall immediately inform the Publisher about such faults if and when detected by Pollfish&#39;s monitoring checks.

**2. SPECIAL AGREEMENTS**

In certain cases, and for chosen partners (e.g. big scale Publisher entities) Pollfish offers API integration options, under separate commercial agreements concluded between such partners and Pollfish. The present Agreement, however, applies to these agreements unless otherwise agreed between Pollfish and the above mentioned business partners. In such cases, payment to partners shall be made within a 45day time frame (Net45), commencing always after the 1st day of each calendar month.

**3. REFERRAL PROGRAM**

Pollfish has a referral program in place, through which, a Publisher may introduce Pollfish to other Publishers. By using the Pollfish referral system, a Publisher may gain additional earnings as indicated in [https://www.pollfish.com/referral](https://www.pollfish.com/referral). For earnings from referrals the same rules apply as described in Section 1.3 of PART A of this Agreement above. Please also check points 12 and 15 of PART A Section 5 (&quot;Further warranties and obligations&quot;) of this Agreement below concerning misuse of the Service and the Pollfish referral scheme.

8.1 Purpose limitation

The data importer shall process the personal data only for the specific purpose(s) of the transfer, as set out in Annex I.B. It may only process the personal data for another purpose:

(i) where it has obtained the data subject&#39;s prior consent;

(ii )where necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims in the context of specific administrative, regulatory or judicial proceedings; or

(iii) where necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person.

8.2 Transparency

(a)In order to enable data subjects to effectively exercise their rights pursuant to Clause 9, the data importer shall inform them, either directly or through the data exporter:

(i) of its identity and contact details;

(ii) of the categories of personal data processed;

(iii) of the right to obtain a copy of these Clauses;

(iv) where it intends to onward transfer the personal data to any third party/ies, of the recipient or categories of recipients (as appropriate with a view to providing meaningful information), the purpose of such onward transfer and the ground therefore pursuant to Clause 8.7.

(b) Paragraph (a) shall not apply where the data subject already has the information, including when such information has already been provided by the data exporter, or providing the information proves impossible or would involve a disproportionate effort for the data importer. In the latter case, the data importer shall, to the extent possible, make the information publicly available.

(c) On request, the Parties shall make a copy of these Clauses, including the Appendix as completed by them, available to the data subject free of charge. To the extent necessary to protect business secrets or other confidential information, including personal data, the Parties may redact part of the text of the Appendix prior to sharing a copy, but shall provide a meaningful summary where the data subject would otherwise not be able to understand its content or exercise his/her rights. On request, the Parties shall provide the data subject with the reasons for the redactions, to the extent possible without revealing the redacted information.

(d) Paragraphs (a) to (c) are without prejudice to the obligations of the data exporter under Articles 13 and 14 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

8.3 Accuracy and data minimisation

(a) Each Party shall ensure that the personal data is accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date. The data importer shall take every reasonable step to ensure that personal data that is inaccurate, having regard to the purpose(s) of processing, is erased or rectified without delay.

(b) If one of the Parties becomes aware that the personal data it has transferred or received is inaccurate, or has become outdated, it shall inform the other Party without undue delay.

(c) The data importer shall ensure that the personal data is adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purpose(s) of processing.

8.4 Storage limitation

The data importer shall retain the personal data for no longer than necessary for the purpose(s) for which it is processed. It shall put in place appropriate technical or organisational measures to ensure compliance with this obligation, including erasure or anonymisation of the data and all back-ups at the end of the retention period.

8.5 Security of processing

(a)The data importer and, during transmission, also the data exporter shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of the personal data, including protection against a breach of security leading to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access (hereinafter &#39;personal data breach&#39;). In assessing the appropriate level of security, they shall take due account of the state of the art, the costs of implementation, the nature, scope, context and purpose(s) of processing and the risks involved in the processing for the data subject. The Parties shall in particular consider having recourse to encryption or pseudonymisation, including during transmission, where the purpose of processing can be fulfilled in that manner.

(b) The Parties have agreed on the technical and organisational measures set out in Annex II. The data importer shall carry out regular checks to ensure that these measures continue to provide an appropriate level of security.

(c) The data importer shall ensure that persons authorised to process the personal data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality.

(d) In the event of a personal data breach concerning personal data processed by the data importer under these Clauses, the data importer shall take appropriate measures to address the personal data breach, including measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects.

(e) In case of a personal data breach that is likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the data importer shall without undue delay notify both the data exporter and the competent supervisory authority pursuant to Clause 12.

To the extent it is not possible for the data importer to provide all the information at the same time, it may do so in phases without undue further delay.

(f) In case of a personal data breach that is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the data importer shall also notify without undue delay the data subjects concerned of the personal data breach and its nature, if necessary in cooperation with the data exporter, together with the information referred to in paragraph (e), points ii) to iv), unless the data importer has implemented measures to significantly reduce the risk to the rights or freedoms of natural persons, or notification would involve disproportionate efforts. In the latter case, the data importer shall instead issue a public communication or take a similar measure to inform the public of the personal data breach.

(g) The data importer shall document all relevant facts relating to the personal data breach, including its effects and any remedial action taken, and keep a record thereof.

8.6 Sensitive data

Where the transfer involves personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data, or biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or a person&#39;s sex life or sexual orientation, or data relating to criminal convictions or offences (hereinafter &#39;sensitive data&#39;), the data importer shall apply specific restrictions and/or additional safeguards adapted to the specific nature of the data and the risks involved. This may include restricting the personnel permitted to access the personal data, additional security measures (such as pseudonymisation) and/or additional restrictions with respect to further disclosure.

8.7 Onward transfers

The data importer shall not disclose the personal data to a third party located outside the European Union  (in the same country as the data importer or in another third country, hereinafter &#39;onward transfer&#39;) unless the third party is or agrees to be bound by these Clauses. Otherwise, an onward transfer by the data importer may only take place if:

(i) it is to a country benefitting from an adequacy decision pursuant to Article 45 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 that covers the onward transfer;

(ii) the third party otherwise ensures appropriate safeguards pursuant to Articles 46 or 47 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 with respect to the processing in question;

(iii) the third party enters into a binding instrument with the data importer ensuring the same level of data protection as under these Clauses, and the data importer provides a copy of these safeguards to the data exporter;

(iv) it is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims in the context of specific administrative, regulatory or judicial proceedings;(v)it is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person; or(vi)where none of the other conditions apply, the data importer has obtained the explicit consent of the data subject for an onward transfer in a specific situation, after having informed him/her of its purpose(s), the identity of the recipient and the possible risks of such transfer to him/her due to the lack of appropriate data protection safeguards. In this case, the data importer shall inform the data exporter and, at the request of the latter, shall transmit to it a copy of the information provided to the data subject.

Any onward transfer is subject to compliance by the data importer with all the other safeguards under these Clauses, in particular purpose limitation.

8.8 Processing under the authority of the data importer

The data importer shall ensure that any person acting under its authority, including a processor, processes the data only on its instructions.

(a) The data importer, where relevant with the assistance of the data exporter, shall deal with any enquiries and requests it receives from a data subject relating to the processing of his/her personal data and the exercise of his/her rights under these Clauses without undue delay and at the latest within one month of the receipt of the enquiry or request. The data importer shall take appropriate measures to facilitate such enquiries, requests and the exercise of data subject rights. Any information provided to the data subject shall be in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language.

(b) In particular, upon request by the data subject the data importer shall, free of charge:

(i) provide confirmation to the data subject as to whether personal data concerning him/her is being processed and, where this is the case, a copy of the data relating to him/her and the information in Annex I; if personal data has been or will be onward transferred, provide information on recipients or categories of recipients (as appropriate with a view to providing meaningful information) to which the personal data has been or will be onward transferred, the purpose of such onward transfers and their ground pursuant to Clause 8.7; and provide information on the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority in accordance with Clause 10(c)(i);

(ii) rectify inaccurate or incomplete data concerning the data subject;

(iii) erase personal data concerning the data subject if such data is being or has been processed in violation of any of these Clauses ensuring third-party beneficiary rights, or if the data subject withdraws the consent on which the processing is based.

(c) Where the data importer processes the personal data for direct marketing purposes, it shall cease processing for such purposes if the data subject objects to it.

(d) The data importer shall not make a decision based solely on the automated processing of the personal data transferred (hereinafter &#39;automated decision&#39;), which would produce legal effects concerning the data subject or similarly significantly affect him/her, unless with the explicit consent of the data subject or if authorised to do so under the laws of the country of destination, provided that such laws lays down suitable measures to safeguard the data subject&#39;s rights and legitimate interests. In this case, the data importer shall, where necessary in cooperation with the data exporter:

(i) inform the data subject about the envisaged automated decision, the envisaged consequences and the logic involved; and

(ii) implement suitable safeguards, at least by enabling the data subject to contest the decision, express his/her point of view and obtain review by a human being.

(e) Where requests from a data subject are excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character, the data importer may either charge a reasonable fee taking into account the administrative costs of granting the request or refuse to act on the request.

(f) The data importer may refuse a data subject&#39;s request if such refusal is allowed under the laws of the country of destination and is necessary and proportionate in a democratic society to protect one of the objectives listed in Article 23(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

(g) If the data importer intends to refuse a data subject&#39;s request, it shall inform the data subject of the reasons for the refusal and the possibility of lodging a complaint with the competent supervisory authority and/or seeking judicial redress.

Clause 10

Redress

(a) The data importer shall inform data subjects in a transparent and easily accessible format, through individual notice or on its website, of a contact point authorised to handle complaints. It shall deal promptly with any complaints it receives from a data subject.

(b) In case of a dispute between a data subject and one of the Parties as regards compliance with these Clauses, that Party shall use its best efforts to resolve the issue amicably in a timely fashion.

SECTION III – LOCAL LAWS AND OBLIGATIONS IN CASE OF ACCESS BY PUBLIC AUTHORITIES

Clause 13

Local laws and practices affecting compliance with the Clauses

(a) The Parties warrant that they have no reason to believe that the laws and practices in the third country of destination applicable to the processing of the personal data by the data importer, including any requirements to disclose personal data or measures authorising access by public authorities, prevent the data importer from fulfilling its obligations under these Clauses. This is based on the understanding that laws and practices that respect the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms and do not exceed what is necessary and proportionate in a democratic society to safeguard one of the objectives listed in Article 23(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, are not in contradiction with these Clauses.

(b) The Parties declare that in providing the warranty in paragraph (a), they have taken due account in particular of the following elements:

(i) the specific circumstances of the transfer, including the length of the processing chain, the number of actors involved and the transmission channels used; intended onward transfers; the type of recipient; the purpose of processing; the categories and format of the transferred personal data; the economic sector in which the transfer occurs; the storage location of the data transferred;

(ii) the laws and practices of the third country of destination– including those requiring the disclosure of data to public authorities or authorising access by such authorities – relevant in light of the specific circumstances of the transfer, and the applicable limitations and safeguards;

(iii) any relevant contractual, technical or organisational safeguards put in place to supplement the safeguards under these Clauses, including measures applied during transmission and to the processing of the personal data in the country of destination.

(c) The data importer warrants that, in carrying out the assessment under paragraph (b), it has made its best efforts to provide the data exporter with relevant information and agrees that it will continue to cooperate with the data exporter in ensuring compliance with these Clauses.

(d) The Parties agree to document the assessment under paragraph (b) and make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.

(e) The data importer agrees to notify the data exporter promptly if, after having agreed to these Clauses and for the duration of the contract, it has reason to believe that it is or has become subject to laws or practices not in line with the requirements under paragraph (a), including following a change in the laws of the third country or a measure (such as a disclosure request) indicating an application of such laws in practice that is not in line with the requirements in paragraph (a). 

(f) Following a notification pursuant to paragraph (e), or if the data exporter otherwise has reason to believe that the data importer can no longer fulfil its obligations under these Clauses, the data exporter shall promptly identify appropriate measures (e.g. technical or organisational measures to ensure security and confidentiality) to be adopted by the data exporter and/or data importer to address the situation. The data exporter shall suspend the data transfer if it considers that no appropriate safeguards for such transfer can be ensured, or if instructed the competent supervisory authority to do so. In this case, the data exporter shall be entitled to terminate the contract, insofar as it concerns the processing of personal data under these Clauses. If the contract involves more than two Parties, the data exporter may exercise this right to termination only with respect to the relevant Party, unless the Parties have agreed otherwise. Where the contract is terminated pursuant to this Clause, Clause 15 (d) and (e) shall apply.

(b) If the data importer is prohibited from notifying the data exporter and/or the data subject under the laws of the country of destination, the data importer agrees to use its best efforts to obtain a waiver of the prohibition, with a view to communicating as much information as possible, as soon as possible. The data importer agrees to document its best efforts in order to be able to demonstrate them on request of the data exporter.

(c) Where permissible under the laws of the country of destination, the data importer agrees to provide the data exporter, at regular intervals for the duration of the contract, with as much relevant information as possible on the requests received (in particular, number of requests, type of data requested, requesting authority/ies, whether requests have been challenged and the outcome of such challenges, etc.).

(d) The data importer agrees to preserve the information pursuant to paragraphs (a) to (c) for the duration of the contract and make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.

14.2 Review of legality and data minimisation

(a) The data importer agrees to review the legality of the request for disclosure, in particular whether it remains within the powers granted to the requesting public authority, and to challenge the request if, after careful assessment, it concludes that there are reasonable grounds to consider that the request is unlawful under the laws of the country of destination, applicable obligations under international law and principles of international comity. The data importer shall, under the same conditions, pursue possibilities of appeal. When challenging a request, the data importer shall seek interim measures with a view to suspending the effects of the request until the competent judicial authority has decided on its merits.

It shall also make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request. 

(c) The data importer agrees to provide the minimum amount of information permissible when responding to a request for disclosure, based on a reasonable interpretation of the request.

SECTION IV – FINAL PROVISIONS

Clause 15

Non-compliance with the Clauses and termination

(a) The data importer shall promptly inform the data exporter if it is unable to comply with these Clauses, for whatever reason.

(b) In the event that the data importer is in breach of these Clauses or unable to comply with these Clauses, the data exporter shall suspend the transfer of personal data to the data importer until compliance is again ensured or the contract is terminated. This is without prejudice to Clause 13(f).

(c) The data exporter shall be entitled to terminate the contract, insofar as it concerns the processing of personal data under these Clauses, where:

(i) the data exporter has suspended the transfer of personal data to the data importer pursuant to paragraph (b) and compliance with these Clauses is not restored within a reasonable time and in any event within one month of suspension;

(ii) the data importer is in substantial or persistent breach of these Clauses; or

(iii) the data importer fails to comply with a binding decision of a competent court or supervisory authority regarding its obligations under these Clauses.

In these cases, it shall inform the competent supervisory authority of such non- compliance. Where the contract involves more than two Parties, the data exporter may exercise this right to termination only with respect to the relevant Party, unless the Parties have agreed otherwise.

(d) Personal data that has been transferred prior to the termination of the contract pursuant to paragraph (c) shall at the choice of the data exporter immediately be returned to the data exporter or deleted in its entirety. The same shall apply to any copies of the data. The data importer shall certify the deletion of the data to the data exporter. Until the data is deleted or returned, the data importer shall continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses. In case of local laws applicable to the data importer that prohibit the return or deletion of the transferred personal data, the data importer warrants that it will continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses and will only process the data to the extent and for as long as required under that local law.

(e) Either Party may revoke its agreement to be bound by these Clauses where (i) the European Commission adopts a decision pursuant to Article 45(3) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 that covers the transfer of personal data to which these Clauses apply; or (ii) Regulation (EU) 2016/679 becomes part of the legal framework of the country to which the personal data is transferred.
